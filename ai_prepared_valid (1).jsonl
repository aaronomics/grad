{"prompt":"Evelyn McHale’s Most Beautiful Suicide\n\nA photograph taken four minutes after her death has become the most iconic suicide photo in history\n\nA traffic worker working at the intersection of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue saw a white scarf drifting down from the Empire State Building. Seconds later he suddenly heard a big collision and chaos on the road. People swarmed a limousine parked on the sidewalk. On top of that limousine, landed a woman’s body.\n\nPhoto by Cathy Williams on Unsplash\n\nThe Empire State Building skyscraper project ended in 1931. Behind the grand buildings at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, an estimated 36 people have committed suicide by jumping from the building’s observation deck. Some bodies were stuck in the section that juts out of the building (due to the design of the building which is not straight down), while some bodies were crushed onto the road.\n\nBut there was only one that landed on top of a car, in an unusual position. Her body doesn’t look like a suicide. The position and the look on her face look like a sleeping beauty. This is Evelyn McHale, the most beautiful and beautiful suicidal person ever.\n\nEvelyn Francis McHale was an American bookkeeper person who committed suicide by jumping from the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building on May 1, 1947. A photograph taken four minutes after her death by photography student Robert Wiles has become the most iconic suicide photo, also known as the most beautiful suicide.\n\nEvelyn Francis McHale was born on September 20, 1923, in Berkeley, California. She was the sixth of seven children of Vincent and Helen McHale. Around 1930, Evelyn’s parents divorced, sources say, and her mother had mental health problems. Evelyn and her brother then lived with their father.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Evelyn later joined the Women’s Army Corps and was stationed in Jefferson, Missouri. It was reported that after her service was over, she burned her uniform. It is not known what exactly Evelyn’s motive was to do that.\n\nAfter World War II, Evelyn moved to Baldwin, New York to live with her brother and brother-in-law. There she worked in finance at a company in Manhattan.\n\nAt a New Year’s Eve party in 1945, she met Barry Rhodes. Rhodes was a former student studying at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Rhodes also served in the army and aspired to be an engineer.\n\nThe couple had actually planned their wedding at Barry’s brother’s house in Troy, New York, which was planned to take place in June 1947. With the joy of being a bride and marrying a loved one, Evelyn somehow decided to end her life just a month before her wedding.\n\nEvelyn’s high school graduation picture, 1942. Source: codex99\n\nEvelyn McHale’s Suicide Chronology\n\nOn April 30, 1947, Evelyn left for Easton. She went to visit her fiancé Barry Rhodes to celebrate her 24th birthday. The next day on Thursday morning, she boarded a train to return to New York City at 7 a.m. on May 1, 1947.\n\nBarry told the media crew who interviewed him that when the two were about to split up, he briefly kissed her and said goodbye. Evelyn seemed happy, normal as ever, nothing at all strange.\n\nNo one thought that in the girl’s head there was already a crazy plan. When she arrived at Penn Station around 9 a.m., Evelyn went across the street to the Clinton Hotel where she wrote a suicide note and walked two blocks east. There, the woman then purchased a ticket to the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building.\n\nAt 11 a.m., a body landed on the roof of a Cadillac limousine parked about 200 feet west of Fifth Avenue. That body was none other than Evelyn McHale.\n\nPeople scattered and roared towards the Cadillac. The atmosphere of the traffic flow became chaotic. Four minutes after Evelyn’s body landed on a U.N. limousine parked on the side of the road, a photography student named Robert Wiles ran across the street and took a photo of her. This photo will one day become the most beautiful iconic photo of suicide.\n\nThe photo shows Evelyn looking peaceful as if she was just asleep, lying in broken glass and steel. The dead Evelyn was seen holding a pearl necklace with her gloved left hand. Her legs seem neatly crossed. But all around her, shattered glass and metal shards on the roof of the car showed just how powerful the 1,040-foot jump was.\n\nWhen police arrived at the 1,050-foot observation deck, they found a neatly folded suit and a small handbag belonging to Evelyn placed on the side of the fence. Also found were several family photos and a small notebook that appeared to be her will. The note read:\n\n“I don’t want anyone in or out of my family to see any part of me. Could you destroy my body by cremation? I beg of you and my family — don’t have any service for me or remembrance for me. My fiance asked me to marry him in June. I don’t think I would make a good wife for anybody. He is much better off without me. Tell my father, I have too many of my mother’s tendencies.”\n\nIn a note addressed to her sister it was more or less said that she was skeptical of marriage and felt that she could never be a good wife. She also said she wanted her body cremated.\n\nEvelyn’s body was identified by her sister Helen Brenner and according to her wishes on her will, Evelyn’s body was later cremated with no memorial, service, or grave. Her fiancée, Barry, was known to have moved to Florida after the death. He never got married.\n\nMeanwhile, the photo was taken on May 1, 1947, by Robert C. Wiles became very famous. Time magazine even called it the most beautiful suicide. Details of this photo by Robert C. Wiles were published as “Photo This Week” in the May 12, 1947 issue of LIFE Magazine.\n\nAfter the Wiles photo appeared in LIFE magazine, it was widely republished in several photographic anthologies and became one of the most iconic photographs of the 20th century.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nLives of the Poor in Archaic Greece\n\nArchaic Greece was a period of time that took place between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE. It was a time of great change in Greek society, where the city-states were just starting to form and the Greek culture was beginning to develop. However, it was also a time of great hardship for the poor.\n\nThe poor in Archaic Greece were often farmers who worked the land for little pay. They were not able to make enough money to support themselves and their families, and many of them lived in poverty. They had to rely on the generosity of others to survive.\n\nThere were many challenges that the poor faced in Archaic Greece. They did not have access to education or healthcare, and they were often subjected to discrimination and prejudice. They were also vulnerable to disease, famine, and war.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges that the poor faced in Archaic Greece was the lack of access to education. Education was only available to the wealthy, and the poor were often illiterate. They were not able to read or write, which made it very difficult for them to find work or improve their situation.\n\nHealthcare was also a major challenge for the poor in Archaic Greece. They did not have access to modern medicine, and many of them suffered from illnesses that could have easily been treated if they had access to proper medical care. This lack of healthcare was a major contributor to the high mortality rates among the poor.\n\nDiscrimination and prejudice were also major challenges for the poor in Archaic Greece. They were often looked down upon by the wealthy, who saw them as inferior. This discrimination made it difficult for the poor to find work or make any kind of social or economic progress.\n\nThe poor in Archaic Greece also faced a great deal of vulnerability. They were often subject to disease, famine, and war. Disease was rampant in ancient Greece, and the poor were especially vulnerable due to their lack of access to healthcare. Famine was also a frequent occurrence, and the poor were often the first to suffer. War was also a constant threat, and the poor were often drafted into the army and sent off to fight in battles that had nothing to do with their own interests.\n\nDespite all of these challenges, the poor in Archaic Greece were able to survive and even thrive in some cases. They developed their own culture and way of life, and they were able to make meaningful contributions to Greek society.\n\nOne of the ways in which the poor in Archaic Greece were able to survive was through their reliance on community support. They often banded together to help each other out in times of need. This sense of community was especially important during times of famine or war, when the poor relied on each other to survive.\n\nAnother way in which the poor in Archaic Greece were able to survive was through their ingenuity and resourcefulness. They were often able to make do with very little, and they were able to find ways to make their own clothes, tools, and other necessities.\n\nDespite their hardships, the poor in Archaic Greece were also able to make meaningful contributions to Greek society. They were often the backbone of the economy, working as farmers or laborers. They also played important roles in Greek religion, serving as priests and priestesses in many cases.\n\nOne of the most famous contributions that the poor made to Greek society was in the area of philosophy. Many of the great philosophers of ancient Greece, such as Socrates and Diogenes, were from humble backgrounds and had to struggle to gain an education. Their ideas and philosophies had a profound impact on Greek society and continue to be studied and debated to this day.\n\nIn conclusion, the lives of the poor in Archaic Greece were marked by hardship and adversity. They faced enormous challenges, including a lack of education and healthcare, discrimination and prejudice, and vulnerability to disease, famine, and war. However, they were also able to find ways to survive and even thrive in some cases. They relied on community support, were resourceful and ingenuous, and made important contributions to Greek society. The stories of the poor in Archaic Greece are a testament to the human spirit and remind us that even in the most difficult of circumstances, people are able to find ways to persevere and overcome adversity.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHave you ever heard of the phrase, \"Go For The Juggler\"? It's a funny phrase, but it actually has a deeper meaning. Nigel Roth, the author of the book, \"Go For The Juggler,\" explains that it means to go for the most important thing first. In other words, don't waste time on unimportant things.\n\nIn the book, Nigel Roth shares many examples of how people waste time on things that don't really matter. For example, he talks about how people spend hours watching TV or playing video games, but they don't spend any time learning something new or working on a project that could benefit them in the long run.\n\nI think this is a really important lesson for all of us, especially as students. We have so many things to do every day, from going to school to doing homework to hanging out with our friends. It can be really hard to prioritize and figure out what's most important. But if we can learn to \"go for the juggler,\" we'll be much more successful in the end.\n\nSo, what exactly does it mean to \"go for the juggler\"? Well, let's say you have a big project due at the end of the week. You could spend your time doing other things, like watching TV or playing video games, but that won't help you get the project done. Instead, you need to focus on the most important thing first, which is the project. That means setting aside time each day to work on it, even if it's just for 30 minutes. By doing this, you're prioritizing the project and making it your main focus.\n\nAnother example of how to \"go for the juggler\" is with studying. Let's say you have a test coming up in a week. You could spend your time doing other things, like hanging out with friends or playing sports, but that won't help you do well on the test. Instead, you need to focus on studying for the test. That means setting aside time each day to review the material, even if it's just for 15 minutes. By doing this, you're prioritizing the test and making it your main focus.\n\nI think one of the biggest challenges when it comes to \"going for the juggler\" is avoiding distractions. There are so many things that can distract us from what's most important, whether it's our phones or social media or even just our own thoughts. But if we can learn to focus and avoid distractions, we'll be much more productive and successful.\n\nAnother important aspect of \"going for the juggler\" is being proactive. That means taking action and making things happen, rather than just waiting for things to happen to you. For example, let's say you want to join a sports team at school. You could wait for someone to ask you to join, or you could take the initiative and talk to the coach yourself. By being proactive, you're taking control of your own life and making things happen.\n\nI think one of the reasons why \"going for the juggler\" is so important is because it helps us achieve our goals. When we prioritize what's most important, we're more likely to accomplish what we set out to do. And when we're proactive and take action, we're more likely to succeed.\n\nOf course, it's not always easy to \"go for the juggler.\" There are times when we get overwhelmed or don't know where to start. But that's okay. The important thing is to take a deep breath, focus on what's most important, and take action. Even if it's just a small step, it's still progress.\n\nIn conclusion, \"going for the juggler\" is an important lesson for all of us, especially as students. By prioritizing what's most important, avoiding distractions, and being proactive, we can achieve our goals and be successful in all aspects of our lives. As Nigel Roth says, \"If you want to achieve something great, you have to go for the juggler.\" So let's do it. Let's prioritize what's most important and make it happen.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nLondon is a city that is brimming with history, culture and vibrancy. It is one of the most visited cities in the world, and is often touted as a top tourist destination. But beneath the surface of London’s charm and allure lies an undeniable sense of ego. The city has a certain air of superiority about it, and this can be seen in a number of different ways.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious manifestation of London’s ego is in the way that it views itself as the most important city in the UK. It is the capital city, after all, and is home to the UK’s most powerful institutions, including the government and the monarchy. But this sense of superiority is not confined to the UK alone – London also views itself as a global city, one that is on par with other major metropolises like New York, Tokyo, and Paris. This is evident in the way that the city markets itself to the world, with slogans like “The World in One City” and “The Capital of the World”. In many ways, London’s ego is tied to its status as a global hub of culture, finance, and politics.\n\nBut this ego is not just a product of London’s position in the world – it is also built into the city’s physical and cultural landscape. For starters, London is a city that is deeply intertwined with its own history. This is evident in the numerous historical landmarks and monuments that dot the city, from the Tower of London to Buckingham Palace to the British Museum. Many of these buildings and institutions are not just symbols of London’s past, but are also testaments to its ongoing importance and relevance. They serve as reminders that London has been around for centuries, and will continue to be a major player on the world stage for years to come.\n\nLondon’s ego is also evident in its culture. The city is home to some of the world’s most famous museums, galleries, theaters, and concert halls. It is a center of fashion, music, and art, and is constantly producing new trends and styles that are exported around the world. The city’s cultural contributions are so significant that London has been named a UNESCO City of Literature, a designation that recognizes its ongoing impact on global culture.\n\nBut this cultural ego is not just a product of London’s creative output – it is also deeply embedded in the city’s geography. London is a sprawling metropolis that is divided into dozens of distinct neighborhoods, each with its own character and history. These neighborhoods are fiercely loyal to their own identity, and often view themselves as more important or distinctive than other parts of the city. This can create a sense of pride and ownership among residents, but can also fuel a sense of rivalry and competition between neighborhoods. In some cases, this rivalry can even become violent – as was the case in the 2011 London riots, which were fueled in part by tensions between different neighborhoods.\n\nAll of these factors combine to create a sense of ego that is palpable throughout the city. London is a place where people are proud to be from, and where visitors are made to feel like they are in the center of the world. But this ego is not always a positive force, and can have negative effects on the city and its residents.\n\nOne way in which London’s ego can be harmful is in the way that it perpetuates inequality and exclusion. Despite being a global hub of culture and commerce, London is also one of the most unequal cities in the world. The gap between rich and poor is massive, and many neighborhoods are deeply segregated along class and ethnic lines. This means that some parts of the city enjoy all of the benefits of London’s ego – access to the best jobs, the best schools, the best healthcare – while others are left behind. This can create a sense of resentment and anger among those who feel excluded from the city’s narrative of success and achievement.\n\nAnother way in which London’s ego can be harmful is in the way that it crowds out other voices and perspectives. When a city is so convinced of its own importance and relevance, it can be difficult for other viewpoints to gain traction. This can be especially true when it comes to issues like politics, where London’s dominance can make it hard for other parts of the country to have their voices heard. It can also be true in the realm of cultural expression, where London’s cultural output can drown out the voices of other regions and cultures.\n\nAt the same time, however, London’s ego can also be a force for good. The city’s sense of pride and ambition can fuel innovation and creativity, and can inspire people to aspire to great things. London’s global status means that it is uniquely positioned to tackle some of the world’s most pressing issues, from climate change to inequality to the refugee crisis. And the city’s cultural dominance means that it has the power to shape the way that people around the world think and feel about art, music, and literature.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether London’s ego is a positive or negative force depends on one’s perspective. For some, the city’s sense of pride and ambition is a source of inspiration and aspiration. For others, it is a source of exclusion and inequality. But regardless of one’s viewpoint, there is no denying that London’s ego is a powerful force that shapes the city and its residents in profound ways. It is a force that will continue to shape the city for years to come, and will play a key role in defining London’s place in the world.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Statistical Learning Theory Part 1\n\nIntroduction to Statistical Learning Theory\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 1920s, Fisher described different problems of estimating functions from given data as the problems of parameter estimation of specific models and suggested the Maximum Likelihood method for estiamting the unknown parameters in all these models.\n\nGlivenko and Cantelli proved that the empirical distribution function converges to the actual distribution function and Kolmogorov found the asymptotically exact rate of this convergence to be exponentially fast and independent of the unknown distribution function.\n\nThese two events gave birth to two main approaches to statistical inference, Parametric and Non-parametric inference. Parametric inference aims to create simple statistical methods of inference that can be usedfor solving real-life problems. Non-parametric inference on the other hand, aims to find one inductive method for any problem of statistical inference.\n\nParametric inference is based on the assumption that the processes generating the stochastic properties of the data and the function whose finite parameters needs to be estimated are known to the person handling the data and for this one adops the maximum Likelihood method.\n\nNon-parametric inference on the other hand, assumes that one does not have a priori information about the process or the function to be approximated, and thus finding a method for approximating the function from the data is necessary.\n\nThe three beliefs that forms the basis of classical parametric paradigm are:\n\nTo find a functional dependency from the data, it is possible to find a set of functions, linear in their parameters, that contains a good approaximation to the desireed function, and the number of free parameters describing this set is small. The statistical law underlying the stochastic component of most real-life problems involving large number of random components is described by the normal law. The Maximum Likelihood method is a good tool for estimating parameters.\n\nHowever, the parametric inference paradigm has its own shortcomings.\n\nCurse of Dimensionality : Increasing the number of dimensions increases the required amount of computational resources exponentially. Statistical components of Real-life problems distributions are described by only classical statistical distribution functions. Maximum Likelihood method does not perform best for some simple problems of density estimation.\n\nIn 1958, after F. Rosenblatt suggested the Perceptron for solving the simple learning problems, several different learning machines were suggested. The genral induction principle that these machines implemented was the so-called Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) principle. The ERM principle suggests a decision rule (an indicator function) that minimizes the number of training errors.\n\nHowever, the issues which drove the developement of the ERM theory, that is, to describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for which the ERM method defines functions that converges to the best possible solution with an increasing number of observations and to estimate both the probability of error for the function that minimizes the empirical risk on the given set of training examples and how close this probability (of error) is to the smallest possible for the given set of functions. The resulting theorems described the Qualitative model and the Generalization ability of the ERM principle respectively.\n\nTo construct the general theory of ERM method for pattern recognition, a generalization of the Glivenko-Cantelli-Kolmogorov theory was made:\n\nFor any given set of events, to determine whether the uniform law of large numbers holds. If uniform convergence holds, to find the bounds for the nonasymptotic rate of uniform convergence.\n\nThese bounds are generalizations of Kolmogorov’s bound in two respects :\n\nThey must be valid for a finite number of observations. They must be valid for any set of events.\n\nThis theory gave rise to the concept of capacity for a set of events (a set of indicator functions). Out of these, the concept of VC dimension is of particular importance. VC dimension of a set of events characterizes the variability of the set of events. Both the necessary and sufficient conditions of consistency and the rate of convergence of the ERM principle depend on the capacity of the set of events implemented by the learning machine.\n\nFor any level of confidence, an equivalent form of the bounds for the rate of uniform convergence define bounds on the probability of the test error simultaneously for all functions of the learning machine as a function of the number of training errors, of the VC Dimension of the set of functions implemented by the learning machine and of the number of observations. Achieving this form of bounds has two requirements — to minimize the number of training error and to use a set of functions with a small VC dimension. The above two requirements are contradictory. That is, to minimize the number of tranining errors, one needs to choose from a wide set of functions, rather than a narrow set with small VC dimension. Hence, finding the best guaranteed solution requires making a compromise between the accuracy of approximation of the training data and the capacity (VC dimension) of the set of functions, that is used to minimize the number of errors. This idea of minimizing the test error by making a trade-off between these two factors was formalized by introducing a new induction principle, known as the Structured Risk Minimzation principle.\n\nTwo important points in connection with the capacity concept :\n\nCapacity determines both the necessary and sufficient conditions for consistency of learning processes and the rate of convergence of learning processes nad thus reflects intrinsic properties of inductive inference. Naive notions of complexity does not reflect capacity properly.\n\nIn many real-life problems, the goal is to find the values of an unknown function only at points of interest (test set). To do this, first we find an estimation of the function from a given set of functions using inductive inference, and then we use that function to evaluate the values of the unknown function at the points of interest. Thus, we solve a problem which is more general in nature than we need to solve. But in cases where we have limited amount of data, we cannot estimate the values of the function at all points of its domain but can estimate the values of the unknown function reasonably well at given points of interest. This type of inference is called transductive inference.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nTime series forecasting models are widely used in industries such as finance, economics, and engineering to predict future values of a variable based on past observations. These models are key to helping businesses anticipate future trends and make decisions accordingly. In this essay, we will discuss the different types of time series forecasting models and their applications for business forecasting.\n\nOne of the most popular time series forecasting models is the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. The ARIMA model is used to forecast the future values of a variable based on its past values, and it is made up of three components: the autoregressive (AR) component, the integrated (I) component, and the moving average (MA) component. The AR component models the relationship between the current value of the variable and its past values, while the MA component models the relationship between the current value of the variable and the errors of past predictions. The I component is used to remove any trends or seasonality in the data, making it more stationary and easier to model.\n\nAnother popular time series forecasting model is the seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model, which is an extension of the ARIMA model that takes into account seasonal patterns in the data. The SARIMA model is useful for forecasting variables that show repeating patterns over time, such as sales data for a particular product that is affected by seasonal changes in consumer behavior.\n\nIn addition to the ARIMA and SARIMA models, there are other time series forecasting models that are useful for different types of data. For example, the exponential smoothing (ES) model is useful for forecasting time series data that show a low level of variability over time. The ES model is based on the assumption that the future value of a variable will be a weighted average of its past values, with more weight given to more recent values.\n\nAnother time series forecasting model that is commonly used is the dynamic regression (DR) model, which is useful for forecasting variables that are affected by external factors. The DR model is based on the assumption that the future value of a variable is a function of not only its past values but also the values of other related variables. For example, a DR model could be used to forecast sales data for a particular product based on not only its past sales data but also on the prices of competing products or the overall state of the economy.\n\nFinally, machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and support vector machines can also be used for time series forecasting. These models are particularly useful for complex datasets that may have non-linear relationships between variables. However, these models can be more difficult to interpret than traditional time series forecasting models, and they can require a large amount of data to train effectively.\n\nIn summary, time series forecasting models are a crucial tool for businesses to make informed decisions based on future trends. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and its seasonal variation (SARIMA) are popular choices for forecasting time series data, while exponential smoothing (ES) and dynamic regression (DR) models are used for data with low variability and external factors, respectively. Machine learning algorithms can also be valuable for complex datasets, but they require a large amount of data and can be difficult to interpret. By using these different models, businesses can make more accurate predictions and optimize their strategies to achieve their goals.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"History’s Oldest Alliance\n\nThe alliance between two countries which survived more than 600 years of conflict\n\nPainting of the marriage between Philippa of Lancaster (the daughter of the Duke of Lancaster) and King John of Aviz (the king of Portugal at the time)\n\nAlliances between countries are one of the oldest forms of geopolitical interaction. Most come and go as time passes and the strength and interests of each nation, empire or group of people shifts. Multiple types of alliances exist of which the most of note are military alliances (e.g. NATO) and economic alliances (e.g. the Soviet Molotov plan).\n\nThe type of alliance we will focus on today is a bilateral military one meaning it is a military treaty between only two nations, something we don’t really see today as many global alliances are formed by multiple nations such as NATO or the now-dissolved Warsaw Pact.\n\nIberia\n\nThe Iberian peninsula has always been contested by multiple geopolitical entities. The fight over the peninsula goes back to the Roman times when it was invaded by the Visigoths then by the Umayyad empire then Reconquista’d by the Catholic Europeans leaving behind something which resembles the borders that we know today.\n\nIn the 1300s the peninsula was dominated by three main powers. These powers were Portugal, Castile and Aragon, the weakest of which was Portugal. Due to this imbalance of power on the peninsula the isolated Portugal sough powerful allies to ensure their independence from the might of Castile. This is where the United Kingdom (then the Kingdom of Britain) came in.\n\nBritain had a history with Portugal even before Portugal sought an alliance with them. The most significant of these moments was during the Siege of Lisbon where English crusaders, as well as other northern European crusaders, stopped during their journey to the holy land to help the Portuguese retake control of Lisbon, something which they did successfully. With such a long history behind their friendship as well as shared hate for the Spanish (then Castilians), the Portuguese decided that they wanted to make the friendship between the two countries official.\n\nThe Treaty of Windsor\n\nOn 9 May 1386, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Portugal signed the Treaty of Windsor. This treaty stated that:\n\nPortrait of King John I of Portugal\n\nThe military treaty was legitimised through the marriage of Philippa of Lancaster (the daughter of the Duke of Lancaster) and King John of Aviz (the king of Portugal at the time). Since its signing in 1386, the two independent nations would not go to war against one another.\n\nThe caveat of independent has to be applied as Portugal once fell under the personal union (basically being inherited) of Castile during the Iberian Union era from 1580–1640 during which Portugal was forced to fight against Britain during conflicts where Spain was also involved most notably during the Dutch–Portuguese War from 1602 to 1663 and the Anglo-Spanish War from 1585 to 1604.\n\nOtherwise except for this 60-year exception each nation aided the other when required. England helped Portugal once it broke free from the Spanish crown, aiding in the countries defence during multiple conflicts. On the other hand, Portugal would show their support most notably during the world wars and the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nDuring the world wars, supply and manpower help was given to the UK by Portugal. During the Napoleonic Wars, Portugal acted as the gateway to Europe for the British. This statement is twofold as Britain was blocked both economically and militarily from the European mainland. Economic restrictions were placed on the UK by Napoleon through the Continental system which disallowed any European country to trade with the UK, a rule which Portugal breached successfully allowing British goods to enter Europe. Portugal also acted as the perfect springboard for a British invasion of France through Spain at the end stages of the Napoleonic wars.\n\nThe alliance continues to be active although it is no longer bilateral. The alliance survives through both Portugal and the UK being part of NATO, continuing more than 600 years of mutual cooperation and alliance between the two western European countries.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Station Eleven presents a poignant and compassionate understanding of the troubles of modern life through the imagination of its destruction. It looks back on the present from a post-pandemic future, noticing the beauty, the superficiality, the technology, and the absurdity of its existence. The storyline oscillates back and forth in time, weaving between characters in the past and present, between places familiar and imagined. It jumps from a dinner party in Los Angeles to a beach in Malaysia to the fantasy world of Miranda’s Station Eleven, connecting Arthur, his ex-wives, his friends, and his co-workers to the people in the airport terminal and the Traveling Symphony. Through these disjunctions, Station Eleven constructs its own narrative of history by deconstructing both time and place. More specifically, it resists the idea that history progresses linearly– mirroring ideas found in Horkheimer and Adorno’s Dialectic of Enlightenment– through its fluid conceptualization of time, its critique of modernity, and its appreciation of the surprising beauty that flourishes in the ruins of modernity.\n\nIn the same way Horkheimer and Adorno understand that “the curse of irresistible progress is irresistible regression” (28), Station Eleven too is conscious of the pitfalls of the modern world and the mythical illusion of progress. Despite the advanced technological moment that the pre-collapse world is set in, its characters are plagued by unhappiness. When Miranda sits down with Arthur in his dressing room to talk, she wonders to herself, “did this happen to all actors, this blurring of borders between performance and life?”. “The man playing the part of the aging actor sipped his tea, and in that moment, acting or not, it seemed to her that he was deeply unhappy” (Mandel, 211). Arthur’s fame and career force him to continually perform, to retreat further and further away from his authentic self. His identity is so inauthentic and performative that he cannot sustain his relationships; when asked “which one?” upon mention of his ex-wife, he realizes “this was a sign of having gone seriously astray, wasn’t it? Having more than one ex-wife?” (Mandel, 320). Arthur is not the only one who feels he has lost himself and what is important. During the 360 report, a young woman named Dahlia articulates a profound, shared depression characteristic of the modern world. She notices the expected drudgery inherent in life, commenting to Clark that “adulthood’s full of ghosts… high functioning sleepwalkers, essentially” (Mandel, 163). When she says this, Clark realizes, “when was the last time he’d been truly moved by anything? When was the last time he felt awe or inspiration?” (Mandel, 164). As he recognizes his own numbness and the despicability of his life’s work, progress and modernity are again critiqued as being mere illusion. In contrast, when he enters the new world, Clark shaves the left side of head and “after all these years of corporate responsibility, the haircut made him feel like himself again” (Mandel, 249). Authenticity is just one of the many things that struggles to survive in the seemingly progressive modern world.\n\nStation Eleven reshapes the conventional understanding of linear progress not just by critiquing the modern world, but by showing the beauty in its destruction. As the people in the Severn City Airport notice, “time had been reset by the catastrophe” (Mandel, 231), turning “progress” on its head and imagining a world that seems to go back in time. Interestingly, this regression is characterized not necessarily by pain and struggle, but by feelings of awe, inspiration, and appreciation that failed to exist in the old, seemingly modern world. When we are first introduced to the post-pandemic world, we are told, “what was lost in the collapse: almost everything, almost everyone, but there is still such beauty” (57). The new world is thus bookmarked as something valuable in itself; it is not an inherent tragedy to go “backwards”. Throughout the novel, as the new world is lived and experienced, it is similarly described by small moments of appreciation. When Jeevan first steps outside of Frank’s apartment into the streets of his city, he finds “a stark and unexpected beauty, silent metropolis, no movement” (Mandel, 182). Decades into the collapse, this feeling still permeates its characters observations: “in the morning light there was beauty in the decrepitude, sunlight catching in the flowers that had spring up through the gravel of long overgrown driveways, mossy front porches turned brilliant green, a white blossoming bush alive with butterflies. This dazzling world” (Mandel, 296). Unlike in the pre-collapse modern world in which objects like the paperweight get haphazardly moved around and forgotten about, objects regain meaning in the new world. The Museum of Civilization is created because “Clark had always been fond of beautiful objects, and in his present state of mind, all objects were beautiful. He stood by the case and found himself moved by every object he saw there, by the human enterprise each object had required” (255). The contrast between the characters’ ability to enjoy life in the new world and their unhappiness in the old world pointedly disrupts conventional thinking of the linear progress of history. By fracturing time and showing the beauty in modernity’s destruction, Mandel creates her own history that understands progress as myth.\n\nThe political message is not immediately clear in Station Eleven, but Mandel’s willingness to shatter time, to critique the banality of the modern world, and to appreciate the beauty in modernity’s destruction undeniably reveal the politically powerful way the novel uncouples progress and linear time. As she guides the reader through her fragmented narrative, she asks us to reconsider the way that the past, present, and future are commonly conceptualized, to learn to map history unconventionally, and to create new modes of understanding.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"2 Elements Every Writer You Love to Read Has in Common\n\nIf you’re looking to grow your readership, these are your targets\n\nPhoto by Debby Hudson on Unsplash\n\n“Becoming a writer is about becoming conscious. When you’re conscious and writing from a place of insight and simplicity and real caring about the truth, you have the ability to throw the lights on for your reader.” — Anne Lamott, Bird by Bird\n\nA good writer knows that his or her writing is not just the sharing of thoughts, the processing of emotions, or the observations about particular circumstances and experiences. That’s because a good writer doesn’t think that highly of his or her abilities, nor do they make the mistake of thinking that everything in their lives is interesting and worth reading.\n\nRather, a good writer is committed to keeping in touch with what his or her readers are actively ingesting. Though relevancy is important in this equation, it is not the primary motivation of good writers, seeing as more often than not, a good writer gives his or her readers what they need to read rather than simply what is most popular at any given time.\n\nPractically speaking, that means a good writer doesn’t just fixate on the national headlines to drive his or her ideation. Rather, a good writer finds inspiration from the underlying tensions and emotions of the average reader, choosing to go a layer beneath the obvious so as to connect and, at times, challenge the reader in ways that would be beneficial to that reader’s livelihood.\n\nIt is my belief that many good writers tend to work using a relatively straightforward equation. They may not call each of these categories by the same name, but if you read any good writing, I am certain you will find traces of these elements at play.\n\n10% [Relevancy] + 20% [Personal Interest] + 30%[Relatabiliy] +\n\n40% [Vulnerability] = 100% good writing\n\nThe exact percentages should not be dissected, seeing as each is subject to fluctuation on any given piece or article. However, what should be noted and attended to is how each category corresponds with each other.\n\nAs mentioned above, relevancy can be an important element of good writing, and yet, it accounts for the lowest percentage within this equation. There should be some connection to the reader and their present circumstance, however, if you’ve found yourself engrossed in Amor Towles The Gentleman In Moscow or Delia Owens Where the Crawdads Sing, you quickly begin to realize that relevancy isn’t the top factor that indicates great writing.\n\nI included personal interest in this equation because it goes without saying that good writing largely often comes from areas that personally interest the writer. If you were a mariner, you may be interested in both reading and attempting to write something similar to Hemingway’s The Old Man and The Sea. However, if you were an astrologist, an anthropologist, or an activist, you might lack a personal interest in that lane of material and, therefore, your best writing might be done through a different avenue or topic.\n\nWhile both relevancy and personal interest are important, you will notice that my equation for good writing centers around two larger categories, of which I believe the majority of what we consider to be good writing has in common:\n\n#1 — relatability\n\n#2 — vulnerability\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Inference\n\nThe inference approach is by far the most common one. The question it helps to unravel is: Who’s going to win the election? Of course, we cannot ask every single voter about their preference — it would cost us millions of dollars and an infeasible amount of time (and thanks God for this — otherwise, we would need to watch election debates every weekend!). That’s why pollsters usually select a small, representative group of people and they try to infer the opinion of the whole nation based on the small sample selected.\n\nThis is basically what inference is all about. In general, the goal of inference is to reach a conclusion about the property of the population of interest. Usually, this property is not directly observable, either because we do not have the right tools or because the costs outweigh the benefits. Therefore, we get a representative sample and try to infer the underlying mechanics of the population that generate this property. Since we operate with a small sample, we also strive for characterising any uncertainty we have about the final statement.\n\nHow is the inference made in the example of the election poll? Let’s break it down into three steps:\n\nStep 1: Define a population\n\nThis might sound easier than it actually is. In the simplest scenario the population of interest would be “all the people eligible for voting”. This definition is clear and it would even allow us to list all elements of the population (assuming we have census data at our disposal).\n\nIn reality, this is not the population we should care about, because not everyone votes (thankfully… or not). Therefore, to be more precise, we need to restate the definition to “all the people who will vote on the election day”. Unfortunately, it makes the inference much harder. How can we know who is going to vote? What are the reasons why people vote (or do not vote)? Is it even possible to tell it upfront?\n\nWe need to answer all these questions before we move on if we want to obtain high quality results. After all, this population is the group (and the only group) that affect the election results which is the outcome of our inference process.\n\nStep 2: Describe a model of the population\n\nOnce we met and got to know the main character of the inference (the population), we need to find a representation of how its elements are related to each other. For example, we all know that similar people — people living in the same part of the country, having a similar job (or even similar brain structure [1]) are more likely to manifest similar political views.\n\nIf we are blind to these dependencies, it could skew our results significantly. It’s because without the right model it’s not possible to…\n\nStep 3: Figure out the right sampling method\n\nPolling is possibly one of the most complicated sampling tasks. There’s an infinite number of questions we can ask about its soundness. Is our sample large enough? The difference between candidates can be really small. Are we reaching all possible voters? Some voters could not be reachable. How do we even know that the sample data we collected are correct? Some people can lie to pollsters.\n\nWorse still, once we assume the wrong population model, we end up with a completely biased sample. For example, it can be ok(ish) to approach a random person on the street and ask to share their preferences. However, it might be better to desist from asking their friends that are standing nearby (especially when they’re all waving red-black flags and calling out revolutionary slogans). If we couldn’t resist the temptation, it would not only skew the data, but also effectively decrease the size of the sample since we worked under the assumption that elements of the sample are independent, when in reality, they are not.\n\nMore on various types of biases you can read in this article.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nYes the Body: A Quarantined Review of Spawn\n\nDuring this quarantine season, I have spent a lot of time at home, watching different movies and TV shows. One of the shows that caught my attention was Spawn. It is a superhero movie that aired in 1997, based on the comic book series of the same name. The movie follows the story of Al Simmons, a former Marine who sold his soul to the devil and is resurrected as a Hellspawn to carry out the devil's bidding.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed about Spawn was its dark and eerie feel. The movie opens with a scene of a man being executed in the electric chair. The eerie music and the creepy setting set the tone of the movie. As the story unfolds, we get to know more about Al Simmons and his motivation for seeking revenge against his former boss, Jason Wynn.\n\nOne of the things that I found interesting about Spawn was the way it dealt with the theme of death. Al Simmons is a character who has died but has come back to life as an undead being. The movie explores the concept of death through the eyes of a character who has already experienced it. Al Simmons is constantly reminded of his mortality and his limitations as a Hellspawn. This gave me a new perspective on life and death and made me appreciate the moments that we have in life.\n\nAnother thing that I found interesting about Spawn was its portrayal of the devil. The movie portrays the devil as a manipulative and conniving being who is always looking for ways to gain an advantage over others. This portrayal of the devil was different from what I had seen in other movies and TV shows. It made me realize that sometimes the devil can be subtle and that we should always be on guard against his temptations.\n\nThe special effects used in Spawn were also impressive. The movie was made in 1997, but the special effects still hold up well today. The scenes where Spawn uses his powers to fight off his enemies are particularly impressive. The way that he transforms into different forms and uses his cape as a weapon was very cool to watch.\n\nHowever, the movie does have some flaws. The plot is sometimes confusing, and it takes a while to figure out what is going on. The movie also uses a lot of dark and muted colors, which can make it difficult to see what is happening on screen. The pacing of the movie can also be slow at times, which can make it hard to stay engaged.\n\nOverall, though, I enjoyed watching Spawn. It was a unique take on the superhero genre, and it had a lot of interesting themes and ideas. The special effects were impressive, and the characters were well-developed. While the plot was sometimes confusing and the pacing was slow at times, these were minor issues compared to the overall enjoyment that I got out of watching the movie.\n\nOne of the things that I liked about Spawn was its depiction of the body. Al Simmons is a character who has undergone a physical transformation, and this transformation is a central part of the movie. His body is now covered in metal spikes, and he has superhuman strength and agility. The movie explores the capabilities of his new body and the limitations that he now faces.\n\nThe movie also explores the theme of body image through the character of Wanda, Al Simmons' former girlfriend. Wanda is a character who is in a wheelchair, and she struggles with her self-image because of her disability. The movie shows her coming to terms with her disability and realizing that she can still be beautiful and strong despite her limitations.\n\nThis portrayal of the body was really interesting to me because it showed that our bodies can be a source of strength and power. Even when we face challenges or limitations, we can still find ways to overcome them and be successful. It also showed that our physical appearance does not define us and that we can be beautiful and strong no matter what we look like.\n\nIn conclusion, Spawn is a superhero movie that explores themes of death, revenge, and body image. While the plot can be confusing at times and the pacing can be slow, the special effects and the characters make up for these flaws. The movie's portrayal of the body is particularly interesting, as it shows how our physical appearance can be a source of strength and power. Overall, I would recommend Spawn to anyone who is looking for a unique take on the superhero genre.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe Familial Blackmail Of A Popular Senator\n\nIn the world of politics, the cost of power can be high. With every move and decision, politicians are constantly scrutinized and judged by their constituents. Public support is fragile and can be lost quickly if a scandal is brought to light. In some cases, the threat of scandal can be even more damaging than the scandal itself, especially if it involves family members. The familial blackmail of a popular senator can be a powerful weapon in the hands of those seeking to manipulate and control the political arena.\n\nBlackmail is defined as the practice of obtaining something, typically money, by threatening to disclose embarrassing or damaging information about a person. This type of coercion can be used to control someone’s actions, decisions, or beliefs. When applied to the family members of a politician, blackmail can be even more effective. By threatening to bring shame or dishonor to a politician’s loved ones, the blackmailer can force the politician to do their bidding. This strategy was evident in the recent case of a popular senator who was being blackmailed by his own family.\n\nThe senator in question had been in office for several terms and had become a well-known figure in his state. He was known for his progressive policies and his strong stance on social justice issues. His approval rating was high, and he was considered a shoo-in for re-election. However, his personal life was not without its problems. He had a younger brother who had been in and out of trouble with the law for years. The senator had tried to help his brother in the past, but to no avail.\n\nThe younger brother had recently gotten into even more serious trouble. He had been caught on tape committing a crime and was facing a lengthy prison sentence. The senator had been advised by his advisors to distance himself from his brother and to avoid any association with the criminal case. However, the family had other plans.\n\nThe younger brother and his mother had approached the senator and demanded that he use his influence to get the charges dropped. When the senator refused, they threatened to go to the media with damaging information about the senator’s personal life. They had evidence of a past affair that the senator had engaged in and promised to release it to the public if he did not comply with their demands.\n\nThe senator was torn between his loyalty to his family and his responsibility to his constituents. He knew that if the affair was made public, it would be a major blow to his reputation and his chances of being re-elected. He also knew that if he used his influence to help his brother, it would be a clear violation of his ethical obligations as a politician.\n\nThe senator decided to seek advice from his closest advisors. They advised him to take a firm stand against his family and to refuse to use his position for personal gain. They also suggested that he take preemptive measures to protect himself from any future blackmail attempts. The senator took their advice and went public with the story.\n\nIn a press conference, the senator revealed the blackmail attempt and the evidence of the affair. He explained that he had refused to use his position for personal gain and had instead chosen to uphold his ethical obligations as a politician. He also stated that he would take legal action against anyone who attempted to blackmail him or his family in the future.\n\nThe public reaction to the senator’s decision was mixed. Some praised him for his courage and transparency, while others criticized him for bringing his personal life into the public sphere. However, the senator’s approval rating remained high, and he was re-elected in the next election with a wide margin.\n\nThe case of the familial blackmail of a popular senator highlights the power dynamics that exist in the world of politics. Blackmail can be an effective tool for those seeking to manipulate and control politicians, especially if it involves family members. However, it can also be a risky strategy for the blackmailer, as the consequences of being caught can be severe.\n\nPoliticians must be aware of the potential risks and consequences of blackmail and take preemptive measures to protect themselves and their families. This can include being transparent about their personal lives, seeking advice from trusted advisors, and taking legal action against anyone who attempts to use blackmail tactics.\n\nIn conclusion, the familial blackmail of a popular senator is a cautionary tale for anyone involved in the political arena. The cost of power can be high, but it is important to remember that ethics and integrity must remain at the forefront of any decision-making process. Politicians must be willing to take a stand against blackmail and to protect themselves and their loved ones from manipulation and control. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of politicians to serve their constituents and the greater good, rather than their own personal interests or those of their family members.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a popular senator who was loved by many people. He had worked very hard to get where he was and he was very proud of his accomplishments. However, one day, his world came crashing down when he received a letter from his family.\n\nThe senator's family was upset with him because he had not visited them in a long time. They told him that they were very disappointed in him and that they would no longer support him if he did not come to see them soon. The senator was very upset by this and he did not know what to do.\n\nHe thought about it for a long time and he decided that he would visit his family as soon as possible. He knew that if he did not, his career and reputation would be ruined. So, he set off on the long journey to his hometown.\n\nWhen he arrived, he was greeted by his family with open arms. They were very happy to see him and they spent a lot of time catching up. However, the senator soon realized that his family had a hidden agenda.\n\nThey wanted him to use his power and influence to help them get what they wanted. They did not care about his career or reputation. They only cared about what he could do for them. The senator was shocked by this and he did not know what to do.\n\nHe tried to reason with his family and explain to them that he could not use his power and influence in that way. However, they did not listen to him. They continued to pressure him and blackmail him until he finally gave in.\n\nThe senator knew that what he was doing was wrong, but he felt like he had no choice. He was afraid that if he did not do what his family wanted, they would ruin him. He was stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\nAs time went on, the senator became more and more unhappy with his situation. He knew that what he was doing was not right and he could not live with the guilt anymore. So, he decided to take a stand.\n\nHe told his family that he would no longer do what they wanted him to do. He said that he would not let them control him anymore. His family was very angry with him and they threatened to ruin him, but the senator stood firm.\n\nHe knew that he was doing the right thing and he would not back down. He was determined to live his life with honor and integrity, even if it meant losing his family's support.\n\nIn the end, the senator's family did try to ruin him. They spread lies about him and tried to discredit him, but the senator had already made a name for himself and people knew who he really was.\n\nHe continued to work hard and he earned the respect and admiration of many people. He proved that he was a man of integrity and honor, and that he would not let anyone control him.\n\nThe senator's story is an important lesson for all of us. It shows us that we should never let anyone blackmail or pressure us into doing something that goes against our beliefs or values. We should always stand up for what is right and never let anyone control us.\n\nIn conclusion, the familial blackmail of a popular senator is a very serious issue. It can ruin a person's career and reputation, and it can also cause a lot of pain and suffering. We should always be aware of the people around us and make sure that they are not trying to manipulate or blackmail us. We should also be strong and stand up for what is right, even if it means losing the support of our loved ones. With determination and courage, we can overcome any obstacle and live a life of honor and integrity.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"This blog is a walkthrough of my project, Predicting Life Expectancies. If you want to fork the repo or follow through the steps in more detail please check out https:\/\/github.com\/roydipta\/life_expectancy\n\nWhat is the importance of trying to predict Life Expectancies?\n\nThe point of this project wasn’t just to predict how long a person would live, but it was more to see what aspects of their lives lead to either higher or lower life expectancies. If we are able to figure out which factors affect life expectancies; this can help guide policy makers to create better laws, it can help guide people to make better life decisions, etc…\n\nFirst things first, WE NEED DATA! There were three sets of data that was pulled. Life Expectancy (2000–2015) from the World Health Organization (WHO), Obesity Among Adults by Country (1975–2016) from WHO, and Suicide Rates Overview (1985–2016) from UN Development Program, World Bank, and WHO.\n\nWe have our data so let’s get started! We need to import all of the packages that we’ll be using and pull in the data to three data frames (we’ll parse everything later):\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 300)\n\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', 100)\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\n\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nfrom statsmodels.formula.api import ols\n\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler life = pd.read_csv('data\\life_expectancy_data.csv')\n\nsuicide = pd.read_csv('data\\suicide_rates.csv')\n\nobesity = pd.read_csv('data\\obesity_data.csv', index_col=0)\n\nThere’s a whole bunch of data cleaning steps as well as feature engineering steps that had to be done to make the data ‘pretty’ and usable. Please check out the \/data_cleaning_engineering.ipynb file in the github for a full step by step data preparation.\n\nOnce the data was cleaned the dataframes were merged. The three tables were merged with the ‘country’, and ‘year’ column.\n\ndf1 = pd.merge(life, obesity, how='left', on=['country', 'year']) df = suicide.groupby(['country', 'year', 'gdp_per_capita ($)']).suicides_no.sum()\n\ndf = df.to_frame()\n\ndf = df.reset_index(level=['country',\"year\", 'gdp_per_capita ($)']) df2 = pd.merge(df1, df, how='left', on=['country', 'year'])\n\nWe need a place to start, so let’s look at the actual distribution of life expectancies in each country. We’ll use the help of plotly on this:\n\nimport plotly\n\nplotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()\n\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\n\n\n\nx = df_2015.groupby(\"country\")[\"life_expectancy\"].mean().sort_values()\n\ndata = dict(type = 'choropleth',\n\nlocations = x.index,\n\nlocationmode = 'country names',\n\ncolorscale= 'Portland',\n\ntext= x.index,\n\nz=x,\n\ncolorbar = {'title':'Life Expectancy (Age)', 'len':200,'lenmode':'pixels' })\n\nlayout = dict(geo = {'scope':'world'},title=\"Life Expectancy around the world in 2015\")\n\ncol_map = go.Figure(data = [data],layout = layout)\n\ncol_map.show()\n\nWe can see somewhat of a pattern. At first glance, it looks like more developed countries seem to have higher life expectancies. If you focus on the countries in red (meaning highest life expenctancies) you can notice that these countries (Canada, Europe, Austrailia) have free healthcare.\n\nThis is a good start! So we mentioned that it looks like more developed countries seem to have higher life expectancies. Let’s test this hypothesis. We can perform a Two Sampled T-Test to test it. Our null hypothesis in this case is Life expectancy in developed countries is equal to the Life Expectancy in Developing Countries. Our alternative hypothesis is Life expectancy in developed countries is NOT equal to the Life Expectancy in Developing Countries\n\nIn:\n\ndeveloped = df[df['status']== 'Developed']\n\ndeveloping = df[df['status']== 'Developing']\n\ndeveloping.life_expectancy.dropna(inplace=True) stats.ttest_ind(developed['life_expectancy'], developing['life_expectancy'])\n\nOut:\n\nTtest_indResult(statistic=29.76836505889292, pvalue=2.4650861700062064e-170)\n\nSo what does this mean? Our p-value is way under 0.05 which is our confidence interval, meaning we can reject our null hypothesis. If we look at the bar graph we can see that on average Developed countries have at least 15 years more life expectancies than developing countries.\n\nHmm, now I’m wondering why this is the case. In more developed countries there should better access to healthcare. Also, in more developed countries there has to be better access to food and just basic neccesities. We do have a obese table maybe we can see if more developed nations have higher amounts of obesity. Okay, so let’s set up our statistical tests. Our null hypothesis will be that Obesity in Developed countries is the same as Obesity in Developing countries. And our alternative hypothesis is Obesity in Developed countries is NOT the same as Obesity in Developing countries.\n\ndeveloping.obesity.dropna(inplace=True)\n\ndeveloped.obesity.dropna(inplace=True) stats.ttest_ind(developed['obesity'], developing['obesity'])\n\nOut:\n\nTtest_indResult(statistic=8.718160546902753, pvalue=4.985541604428258e-18)\n\nAgain, our P-value is wayyy under 0.05 so we can reject our null hypothesis! This makes sense, the more food we have available the higher obesity it can lead to. I think we got some good statistics. Now we can move onto actually running a regression and seeing which other features are important in predicting life expectancies. Lookout for Part 2! :)\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nGraham Greene’s novel “The End of the Affair” is an exploration of love, faith, and betrayal. Set in wartime London, the novel tells the story of Maurice Bendrix, a man who begins an affair with Sarah Miles, the wife of a prominent civil servant. Their relationship is passionate and consuming, but it ends abruptly when Sarah breaks it off without explanation. Years later, Bendrix seeks to uncover the reason behind the end of their affair, leading him to confront his own beliefs about love and God.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of the novel is the way in which Greene explores the nature of love. Bendrix and Sarah’s relationship is intense and all-consuming, with both characters consumed by a desire for each other that borders on obsession. However, Greene does not romanticize their love, instead portraying it as a destructive force that ultimately leads to pain and suffering. Bendrix, in particular, is unable to let go of his feelings for Sarah, even after their relationship has ended. He becomes bitter and resentful, consumed by his desire for revenge against Sarah for rejecting him. This bitterness ultimately leads him to betray her trust, a decision that he comes to regret profoundly.\n\nAt the same time, however, Greene does not present love as a purely negative force. Despite the pain that their relationship causes, both Bendrix and Sarah are driven by a profound sense of connection to each other. For Sarah, the affair is a way of escaping the stifling constraints of her marriage, while for Bendrix it represents a kind of transcendence, a way of experiencing a love that is beyond the mundane realities of everyday life. In this sense, the novel presents love as a complex and multifaceted emotion, capable of both great beauty and great destruction.\n\nAnother major theme of the novel is faith. Both Bendrix and Sarah are deeply skeptical of religion, but they each come to confront their own beliefs in different ways. For Bendrix, his relationship with Sarah represents a kind of substitute for religious faith. He is drawn to her in part because she represents a kind of transcendent beauty, a force that is larger than himself. However, as their relationship falls apart, Bendrix is forced to confront the possibility that there might be no higher power at work in the universe. He becomes bitter and cynical, doubting the existence of God and questioning the very meaning of his own existence.\n\nSarah, meanwhile, experiences a profound spiritual awakening following the end of her affair with Bendrix. She becomes deeply religious, seeking solace in the idea that there is a higher power at work in the universe, one that is capable of forgiveness and redemption. This newfound faith is a source of comfort for Sarah, giving her a sense of purpose and meaning that she has never had before. However, it also leads to a kind of self-punishment, as Sarah becomes convinced that her suffering is punishment for her own moral failings. Thus, while faith is presented as a source of comfort and hope in the novel, it is also shown to be a complex and often contradictory emotion.\n\nFinally, the novel explores the concept of betrayal. Bendrix’s decision to betray Sarah’s trust is one of the key turning points of the novel, leading to a kind of existential crisis for both characters. However, Greene does not present the act of betrayal as a simple matter of right or wrong. Instead, he portrays Bendrix as a flawed and complicated character, driven by his own desires and insecurities. Bendrix’s betrayal of Sarah is a product of his own bitterness and pain, a way of lashing out against the woman who he believes has wronged him. Sarah, meanwhile, is presented as a victim of her own desires, trapped between her love for Bendrix and her sense of duty to her husband.\n\nIn conclusion, “The End of the Affair” is a powerful and thought-provoking novel that explores some of the most fundamental questions of human existence. Graham Greene’s exploration of love, faith, and betrayal is both nuanced and complex, presenting these emotions as multifaceted and often contradictory. The novel is also notable for its powerful characterizations, particularly in the case of Bendrix, whose bitterness and cynicism are offset by his profound sense of passion and love. Ultimately, “The End of the Affair” is a book that is as much about the human condition as it is about a specific set of characters and events, and it is a testament to Greene’s immense talent as a writer that he is able to achieve such a profound level of insight and depth in his work.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}

Library of America\n\nIn April 1959, Tynan was travelling to Cuba to interview Fidel Castro, who’d recently chased Batista off the island, and called in to see Tennessee Williams — who was living in Key West at the time — suggesting the playwright might like to come along.\n\n“ I’ve arranged to have lunch with Hemingway at the Floridita tomorrow, “ said Tynan, “ why not join us?”\n\n“ Hemingway? You are joking, right? I’ve heard he kicks people like me in the crotch.”\n\n“ Nonsense. But if he does I shall kick him back.”\n\nIn the end curiosity got the better of Williams, and the two writers headed off to Cuba.\n\nThomas Lanier “Tennessee” Williams III, was born in Columbus, Mississippi, on March 26, 1911. His first great theatrical hit, The Glass Menagerie, was staged in 1944. From that moment on he never looked back as a playwright. By the time of the lunch with Hemingway, Sweet Bird of Youth had been doing good business on Broadway for a month, and he was now considered, along with Miller and O’Neill, to be one of America’s greatest playwrights.\n\nTynan. BBC\n\nThe young Kenneth Tynan, in just a handful of years, had changed the way theatre critics wrote, creating a style that was to be taken up by just about every young reviewer thereafter: stylish, Hemingwayesque, no holds barred stuff that gave moulding old British newspaers a new lease of life.\n\nTynan supported, and championed, almost single-handedly, the rise of the so called ‘angry young men’ of literature and the theatre, most notably John Osborne and his play, Look Back in Anger, the success of which, sadly, destroyed the career of Terence Rattigan.\n\nTynan was a rising star.\n\nHemingway was on his last legs with only one more book left in him, and suicide just around the corner.\n\nBut Williams, who admired Hemingway’s work, still feared the tall and big chested novelist who greeted him and Tynan with handshakes and hugs, as they walked into the famous Floridita bar and restaurant.\n\nHemingway ordered Papa Doble (double frozen daiquiris) all round, signed a few autographs, and then had to listen to a trio of singers salute Hemingway with a new song they’d written about a local lesbian who could not, no matter how much she tried “…change her appetites to suit papa.” Hemingway laughed and hugged the singers, tipping them well, before explaining, to Williams and Tynan, that the bronze bust of himself on the bar in the corner was always covered up for Lent.\n\nThe 2003 life size statue replaced the bust. Source: Wikimedia Commons\n\nHemingway then ordered lunch, lobster with a salad, and white wine.\n\nThe group were then joined by another journalist, and sometime friend of Hemingway’s, George Plimpton, who spotted that Tennessee looked slightly terrified, and as Plimpton put it “…Tennessee Williams’ tendencies were perfectly visible and I never saw anything but the greatest respect Hemingway had for him.”\n\nWilliams then told Hemingway he’d met the bullfighter Ordóñez in Spain, describing him as “…a lovely boy, very friendly, very accessible.” Hemingway said nothing. Williams then said:\n\n“ I was introduced to Pauline back in Key West. I was very sorry to hear of her death, what…?”\n\n“ She died like everybody else,” said Ernest, “and after that she was dead.”\n\nThere was something of a pause then:\n\nThe conversation moved on to the air crashes Hemingway and Mary had suffered in Africa, with Hemingway giving detailed descriptions, and how close they came to death, with Hemingway adding:\n\n“ You can survive on one kidney, but if your liver gives out, you’re through.”\n\nHe then made his goodbyes and said what a pleasure it had been:\n\n“ To meet you Tennessee, and can I say how much I enjoy your work, although I’ve never seen any of your plays I do enjoy reading them. Take care of yourself…”\n\n“ Thank you, I will, and you.”\n\nThey both ignored the advice.\n\nIn the summer of 1959 Ernest travelled to Spain to cover the bullfights. He was supposed to write a series of short articles, in the end they turned into a very good book, The Dangerous Summer. Kenneth Tynan turned up in Spain at the same time, gate-crashing Hemingway’s lunches. I think it can be assumed Hemingway had rather gone off the young man who would be the first to use the ‘f’ word on British TV.\n\nTennessee Williams died in 1983, Kenneth Tynan in 1980.\n\nHemingway met Fidel Castro in May 1960, and was told by the new Cuban President that when they were fighting in the mountains they used For Whom the Bell Tolls as a guerrilla manual. That would have pleased Hemingway.\n\nHemingway with Castro.

{"prompt":"\n\nThe Quatrian Grand Theatre in the Age of Song was one of the most magnificent sights in our world. It stood tall and proud like a queen, with its grand marble architecture and ornate decorations. But what made this theatre truly special was the music that flowed from its stage, filling the hearts of all who listened with joy and wonder.\n\nBack in the Age of Song, music was more than just entertainment. It was a way of life, a language that spoke to the soul. People from all over Quatria would come to the Grand Theatre to be moved by the melodies that echoed through its walls. They would sit in the plush, velvet seats, marveling at the beauty of the singers and dancers who graced the stage.\n\nOne of the most famous acts to perform at the Grand Theatre was a group called The Five Sirens. They were five women with voices so pure and sweet, it was said they could make the flowers bloom. They would sing songs of love, of hope, of freedom, and the audience would be spellbound.\n\nBut it wasn't just the singers who made the Grand Theatre so special. The dancers were just as important, with their graceful movements and stunning costumes. They could tell stories with their bodies, transporting the audience to far-off lands and magical worlds.\n\nOne of the most popular dances was called The Dance of the Phoenix. It was a traditional Quatrian dance that told the story of a mythical bird that rises from the ashes. The dancers would move in a circle, their flowing robes creating a rainbow of colors, and the music would build and build until it reached a crescendo, and the audience would feel like they too were being reborn.\n\nOf course, the Grand Theatre wasn't just for music and dance. It was also a place where people could come together to celebrate important events. Weddings, birthdays, and even political rallies were held on its stage. The theatre was a symbol of unity, of the power of art to bring people together.\n\nSadly, the Age of Song did not last forever. As Quatria entered a new era, music and dance began to fall out of favor. The Grand Theatre became a relic of the past, a reminder of a time when the world was filled with magic and wonder. It fell into disrepair, its once-gleaming walls now covered in dust and cobwebs.\n\nBut even in its ruined state, the Grand Theatre continued to inspire. It reminded people of the beauty of music and dance, of the importance of coming together to celebrate life. And slowly but surely, the people of Quatria began to rediscover their love for the arts. They started to look back to the Age of Song, to the days when the Grand Theatre was filled with the sweetest melodies and the most graceful dancers.\n\nToday, the Grand Theatre has been restored to its former glory. The Five Sirens have returned to its stage, filling the air with their heavenly voices. The Dance of the Phoenix has been revived, its colorful robes swirling in the light. And once again, people from all over Quatria come to the theatre to be moved by the magic of music and dance.\n\nThe Quatrian Grand Theatre in the Age of Song may be a relic of the past, but it will always hold a special place in our hearts. Its beauty and wonder will never be forgotten, and its music will continue to inspire generations to come.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nLinear Regression — Basics that every ML enthusiast should know\n\nMachine learning has revolutionized the world of computing and Artificial intelligence. It has been one of the most talked-about subjects in the tech industry in recent years. Linear Regression is one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning that is widely used in many applications such as stock market prediction, weather forecasting, image processing, and many more.\n\nAs an aspiring Machine Learning enthusiast, understanding the basics of Linear Regression is essential. This essay will provide an overview of Linear Regression, including its types, assumptions, algorithm, and applications.\n\nWhat is Linear Regression?\n\nLinear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to establish a correlation between two variables. It predicts the value of an output variable by calculating the relationship between one or more input variables. In simple terms, it predicts the dependent variable's value by observing the independent variables' values.\n\nTypes of Linear Regression\n\nThere are two types of Linear Regression: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression.\n\nSimple Linear Regression:\n\nSimple Linear Regression involves only one independent variable and one dependent variable. It establishes a linear relationship between these variables by fitting the best line that passes through the data points. The equation of the best line for Simple Linear Regression is Y = a0 + a1 X, where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, a0 is the intercept of the line, and a1 is the slope of the line.\n\nMultiple Linear Regression:\n\nMultiple Linear Regression involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable. It establishes a linear relationship between these variables by fitting the best hyperplane that passes through the data points. The equation of the best hyperplane for Multiple Linear Regression is Y = a0 + a1 X1 + a2 X2 + ....+an Xn, where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ....Xn are the independent variables, a0 is the intercept of the hyperplane, and a1, a2,.... an are the slopes of the hyperplane.\n\nAssumptions of Linear Regression\n\nLinear Regression has certain assumptions that must be satisfied for accurate predictions. These assumptions are:\n\n1. Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\n\n2. Independence: The observations are independent of each other.\n\n3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be the same for all levels of the independent variable.\n\n4. Normality: The residuals should be normally distributed.\n\nAlgorithm of Linear Regression\n\nThe algorithm of Linear Regression involves finding the best line that fits the data points. The best line is determined by minimizing the sum of squared errors, which is the distance between the predicted value and the actual value. The algorithm of Linear Regression involves the following steps:\n\n1. Divide the data into training and testing sets.\n\n2. Fit the best line that passes through the training data points.\n\n3. Predict the values of the dependent variable for the testing data points using the fitted line.\n\n4. Evaluate the accuracy of the model using the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (R2).\n\nApplications of Linear Regression\n\nLinear Regression is a versatile algorithm that is widely used in many applications. Some of the applications of Linear Regression are:\n\n1. Stock market prediction: Linear Regression is used to predict the future stock prices by analyzing the past trends.\n\n2. Weather forecasting: Linear Regression is used to predict the weather conditions by analyzing the past weather data.\n\n3. Sales prediction: Linear Regression is used to predict the future sales by analyzing the historical sales data.\n\n4. Medical diagnosis: Linear Regression is used to diagnose various medical conditions by analyzing the symptoms and medical history.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Linear Regression is an essential algorithm that every Machine Learning enthusiast should know. It establishes a correlation between the dependent and independent variables and predicts the value of the dependent variable by observing the independent variables' values. Linear Regression has two types: Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression. It has certain assumptions that must be satisfied for accurate predictions. The algorithm of Linear Regression involves finding the best line that fits the data points. Linear Regression is widely used in many applications such as stock market prediction, weather forecasting, sales prediction, and medical diagnosis.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Have You Lost Your IRL Self?\n\nThe price we pay for a public and private self that no longer match\n\nArtwork: © Carlyn Beccia | www.CarlynBeccia.com\n\nThe first time I saw the acronym “IRL,” I was woefully confused. It implies that your digital self is different from your in-the-flesh self.\n\nObviously, personalities are mutable. The person you were as a teen is not the person you are today. Our bodies break down. Our brains fire new neural synapses. Even our red blood cells cycle out every four months. But those changes happen over space and time.\n\nBut social media allows you to flip a switch with lightning speed. Feeling broken inside today? Just upload a happy picture of you running barefoot on the beach or enjoying a croissant in a Paris bistro. Simply be the person you want the world to see at that moment.\n\nBut here’s the problem with having two identities at one time — accountability. Online behavior has consequences. If you are a jerk online, you are still a jerk. Social media is not a magical safe space where you get to hurt others without repercussions. But that’s the message teens get today when they are allowed a curated and doctored space to polish and perfect their true selves.\n\nThe fakeness starts with photos. Our children are growing up in a world where the pictures they post to social media are filtered to the point that they don’t even look like themselves.\n\nThink about that for a moment. A century from now, we won’t know what some people really looked like. You could argue that eighteenth-century portraiture was idealized too, but that is also why we don’t trust portrait paintings to represent what someone looked like. How will future generations make sense of online photos?\n\nAnd that is just the superficial stuff. What about those who “like” posts when they don’t IRL like the person behind them? In a world of Snapchat filters, perfect gym shots, and happy vacation photos, how do we hold tight to authenticity?\n\nOf course, everyone wants to project an image to the world that represents our best selves. But can we embrace vulnerability if we never let the mask fall?\n\nIt’s a conversation that I will have with my daughter when she is old enough to get on social media. It’s not ok to live a double life. And trying to continually cover up your flaws will exhaust you. It’s a lot easier to live a truth than a lie; a lie takes work.\n\nA perfect example of this dualistic approach to identity is the recent scandal surrounding Ellen Degeneres.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the brouhaha, several of Ellen’s employees have recently come forward about the comedian’s racism and intimidation on her show. And this isn’t just a handful of disgruntled ex-Ellen employees. There are simply too many stories to ignore.\n\nWhen I read about Ellen’s fall from grace, I was disappointed. But not because Ellen was ousted as a grade-A jerk. It’s because she became the poster child for inauthenticity. She projected to the world the image of an honorable person with the tagline “be kind to everyone,” but behind closed doors, she was anything but kind. And that’s not cool.\n\nIt’s a lot easier to live a truth than a lie; a lie takes work.\n\nThen there is romance. Two decades ago, would a man ever walk up to a woman he would like to meet and remove his shirt? Or would a woman walk up to a man and make a kissy face while pushing her breasts together? But today, shirtless men holding up fishes and duckface selfies with awkward camera angles fill every dating app. It’s far too easy to create a Panglossian substitute for our true selves when the IRL world says it is ok to do so.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nIn the past, letters were the primary means of communication between people who were far apart. People spent time and effort writing letters, and as such, they started their letters by addressing the recipient as “dear.” The word “dear” signified a certain level of familiarity between the sender and the recipient. However, in recent times, written communication has evolved drastically, and the appropriate way to start a letter is a contentious issue. The question is, is it time to drop the “dear” from our communication?\n\nThe word “dear” has been used to express affection, love, and intimacy between people. It has been the opening salutation for letters since time immemorial, and it has been seen as the most appropriate way to address someone in a letter. However, in recent times, the use of the word “dear” has come under scrutiny. Many people are questioning its continued relevance in today’s world.\n\nFirstly, the word “dear” can be seen as too formal or too intimate depending on the relationship between the sender and recipient. In a professional setting, starting an email or letter with “dear” might seem too formal, and in some cases, it might indicate a level of intimacy that does not exist between the sender and recipient. For instance, if a boss addresses an employee as “dear,” it might come across as condescending or familiar, especially if they don’t have a close relationship.\n\nAlso, starting a letter with “dear” might not make sense when communicating with someone you have never met before or have no close relationship with. In such cases, the use of “dear” could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the sender is trying to create a neutral or professional tone. For example, if a job applicant writes an email to a potential employer, addressing them as “dear” might seem overly familiar and inappropriate.\n\nSecondly, the use of “dear” can be seen as outdated, and its continued use might indicate a lack of awareness of modern communication methods. Nowadays, people use various forms of communication, such as text messaging, instant messaging, and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These forms of communication are less formal and do not require the use of greetings such as “dear.” As a result, the use of “dear” in modern communication might seem out of place, and it might indicate a lack of familiarity with modern forms of communication.\n\nFurthermore, some people argue that the use of “dear” is unnecessary, and it adds no value to the conversation. It is seen as an empty salutation that is used out of habit rather than necessity. In most cases, the recipient of the email or letter might not even notice the use of the word “dear,” and as such, it does not add any value to the communication. Instead of using “dear,” some people argue that it is better to begin the communication without any salutation or greetings.\n\nOn the other hand, some argue that the use of “dear” is still relevant and should not be dropped from our communication. They believe that “dear” is a polite and courteous way to address someone, especially in a formal or professional setting. The use of “dear” can indicate a level of respect or formality that is necessary in some situations. For example, when writing a formal letter or email to a dignitary or a person of authority, the use of “dear” might be seen as appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, the use of “dear” can be seen as a way of maintaining the tradition of letter writing. Letter writing has been an essential means of communication for centuries, and it has its unique style, tone, and structure. The use of “dear” is part of this tradition, and dropping it might be seen as a disregard for the culture and history of letter writing.\n\nIn conclusion, the use of “dear” in communication has been a subject of debate in recent times. While some argue that it is outdated and unnecessary, others believe that it is still relevant, especially in formal or professional settings. However, as communication methods continue to evolve, it is essential to be aware of the appropriate ways to address someone, depending on the relationship between the sender and recipient. Instead of clinging to the tradition of letter writing, it is necessary to adapt to modern forms of communication and adjust our salutations and greetings accordingly. As such, whether to drop the “dear” from our communication is a matter of personal preference and can be influenced by various factors such as the relationship between the sender and recipient, the tone of the conversation, and the medium of communication.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"The first time I read Beowulf, I was hooked. Set against an ominous backdrop, the flawed hero immortalized for his pride just as much as his courage piqued my interest along with the complexity and foreignness of the archaic language in which the poem is told. It’s like that for a lot of us: One spark starts our journey into academe. That was nearly two decades ago. Today I am one of the only active scholars of color specializing in Early medieval England* in the native-English speaking world. I’ve struggled to prove my worth as a scholar, as my skin color constantly impedes on how I am perceived and in turn what I am capable of achieving. Additionally, I’ve watched as other colleagues of color leave the field. In a field laid claim to by white supremacists, this is a tragedy.\n\nOver the past few years and with alarming frequency, medieval images have been turned into memes, and posted without context on white supremacist websites and social media. One recent example from the website Stormfront proposed a quixotic connection between swastikas and ‘Anglo-Saxons.’ Also on the neo-Nazi website, we find Beowulf grouped with other “western” texts as essential reading. The poem, they believe, links them to a supposed warrior past.** While these posts and the pernicious ideas behind them proliferate, medievalists of early England and our organizational leadership have largely remained silent over the years. One reason for this silence: The field is just too white.\n\nWhy is the field so white? Historically, Early English studies was perceived, taught and studied within an Empirical framework which most often created an implicit bias surrounding ‘British’ origins. The perpetuated false narrative continues to prevent students of color from connecting with the texts, and in short, drives away both students and scholars of color — people who, like me, grow tired of constantly being asked to justify their existence in a field assumed to belong to white people. The same bias is not present in disciplines like African American studies, which boasts of a diverse scholarly community.\n\nI have been told many times I “do not look like an ‘Anglo-Saxonist.’” I’ve even been told after a campus interview, by the chair of a hiring committee (for a job I didn’t get) that the deciding factor against me was the department’s struggle to “justify to their students that [I] was an ‘Anglo-Saxonist.’” My primary area of expertise and the majority of my work concentrates on Anglo-Saxon studies [now early English studies], so what other justification is necessary? Worse, I have witnessed a handful of competent people of color leave early English studies because they believed there was no room for visible minorities to work in the field.\n\nEven the few, barebones opportunities to support diverse scholars are being squandered. The International Society of Anglo-Saxonists (ISAS) has upwards of 700 members. No official stats are available, but judging from the members list, one might generously estimate between 2–3 percent of present members are non-white. At the group’s biannual meeting in Hawaii last year, Dr. Adam Miyashiro, a native Hawaiian, proposed to discuss the ways that Beowulf yields specific readings that continue to be used by white supremacists. He was turned down by organizers. Although many good proposals are turned down — this decision, understandable in the abstract — takes on a different character in a field that consistently shuts out diverse voices. The conversation of race is continuously shifted into the hands of white scholars, even in fields like early English studies which is one of the least equipped fields to discuss critical race theory in relation to its literature and history. Miyashiro (who gave me permission to share his story) and I are not alone in having experienced exclusion, but we are increasingly alone in the field. This is not just about individuals losing out on positions because competition is high, rather there are guardians and gate-keepers on hiring committees committed to keeping the field white. Demonstrably, merit has no meaning.\n\nBy and large, this gate-keeping has been the modus operandi for specialists of early English studies. Silence or resistance to acknowledge scholars of color reinforces ever present white supremacy. Silence makes one complicit, but, on the same hand, so do empty words and undertaking zero practical measures to counter racism. There is nothing structurally available for scholars of color in our field and no movement within academia to work on eliminating racism. People are leaving, deciding to pivot, changing careers, and choosing to never study early English studies or related material because racism is prevalent in our field. Recent attempts to address racism in my field have been done without PoC voices (apart from a number of vulnerable and brave grad students and early career researchers), as was reflected at ISAS 2017. Additionally, when we are present, the people with institutional power are absent as was evident in the abysmal representation of senior scholars for panels centering MoC (Medievalists of Color) voices and emphasizing race-related issues in the field at the Modern Language Association (MLA) Congress 2018 in NYC. (Spoiler alert: no senior-level scholars of early English studies attending the conference were present for those sessions, particularly session 491.)\n\nThe situation in early English studies is not isolated. Plagued by Euro-centrism, Medieval Studies as a whole continues to stumble along in attempts to address ‘otherness’. This was evidenced during last year’s controversy involving the tone-deaf white scholar’s ‘joke’ about ‘otherness’ during the plenary at the annual International Medieval Congress in Leeds. Scholars of color are not just walking away from plenary talks in disgust, they are completely walking away from the field.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Photo by Waqar on Unsplash\n\nGraham Greene only wrote one novel in the first person. Fittingly, it’s the one that most faithfully reflects his own experience. The End of the Affair, released for the first time in 1951, is a thinly disguised account of Greene’s sexual relationship with a married woman named Catherine Walston, to whom the book is dedicated: “To C.” Walston demanded that the real-life affair end after the release of the book that fictionalised its end. But she and Greene started up again and carried on for about another 15 years.\n\nIn The End of the Affair, the narrator is a rising writer called Maurice Bendrix. ‘A story has no beginning or end,’ he tells us. ‘Arbitrarily one chooses that moment of experience from which to look back or from which to look ahead.’ He describes his affair with Sarah Miles, a woman married to a civil servant who is dull and apparently uninterested in (if not uncapable of) sex. He differs from the narrator in that he likes to be comfortable. Bendrix prefers the opposite.\n\nBendrix proceeds to tell the story of how the relationship began and ended, but in a roundabout sort of way. His tale begins long after the affair is over when, by chance, he comes across Henry Miles while walking in south London. After a drink in a nearby pub, they go to Henry’s house, where Henry confides in Bendrix that he suspects his wife is sleeping with someone else. He has thought about hiring a private investigator to find out if his suspicion is true, but hasn’t yet found the courage to go through with it.\n\nHenry has, however, prepared a letter, which sits unopened in his living room. Such is his trust in his wife that he’s sure she won’t open it. Bendrix offers to take the letter and contact the private investigator on Henry’s behalf. And so Bendrix finds himself in the strange position of trying to work out if the woman with whom he had an affair is having another, only with someone else.\n\nThe investigator, Mr. Parkis, gets going, and Bendrix finds himself reflecting on his own affair with Sarah. Here the events of the present begin to tangle themselves up with Bendrix’s reminscences. He remembers how he came to meet Sarah in 1939. He recalls how he wanted to talk to her about Henry because he was writing a book about a civil servant. He remembers Rules, where they often went for lunch, how they watched a film based on one of Bendrix’s books. And he remembers they had had sex, awkwardly, for the first time. He also recalls how his jealousy caused arguments and threatened to derail the relationship.\n\nReading The End of the Affair is a bit like reading an account of madness. But then this kind of love is a sort of madness if allowed to run riot. Bendrix’s affair with Sarah disrupts the productive rhythm of his working life as well as his emotions, which mutate into jealousy and hatred. Of course we’re told by Bendrix that he ‘prefers discomfort’; but a preference for complexity and inconvenience can’t justify the mess he makes for himself. And we should doubt the validity of any first-person narration, especially in this context. Bendrix may simply wish to set himself against the insipid Henry, or to convince himself and us that he enjoyed the instability of his relationship with Sarah.\n\nBut what Greene shows so well, and it’s the skill of the great novelist, is how there are a nearly infinite number of ways to view any one situation. To a point we are all unreliable narrators. In The Heart of the Matter, Scobie wonders if you would have to ‘pity the stars’ if given ‘all the facts’, which points to the way perspective changes with knowledge. In The End of the Affair, Sarah’s diary entries paint a picture of her relationship with Bendrix that differs starkly from the one generated by his account.\n\nIt’s worth noting in spite of what he says at the beginning that Bendrix starts to question his ability to control the story, and even suspects at times that the story may be revealing itself to him as he attempts to tell it. He begins his account by saying that what is to follow is a ‘record of hate’; but he challenges this belief directly part-way through, which suggests that by telling the story Bendrix is working through his emotions. His love may be just ‘as deficient’ as his hate, he says. And love, as Greene shows through the mutation of Bendrix’s emotions, easily becomes hate, and vice versa.\n\nThis being Greene, the novel is shot through with allusions to the divine and with Catholic themes in particular. Bendrix ascribes his hatred and selfishness to a ‘demon’ which points to the absence of God in his life. It invokes the Augustinian idea that evil exists in the mere absence of God, the role of whom grows as the story unfolds. And in the end, good in the everyday, earthly sense is not set against evil, but belief against unbelief — belief and the grace to which it may lead always carrying with it the possibility of redemption for the believer.\n\nThis is a novel of shades of grey, out of which no one comes looking especially admirable. It’s a study of the psychology of the lover, of contradiction, within the human mind and the Catholic mind: we suspect Greene, like Bendrix, is working something out as he writes. The effect is very powerful, and the ending hints at a resolution that may explain why Greene did not write any more novels after The End of the Affair with such overtly Catholic themes.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nWhat Makes An Impossible Figure Impossible?\n\nImpossible figures are fascinating geometric shapes that appear to be three-dimensional but cannot actually exist in our physical world. These figures seem to defy the laws of physics and geometry, prompting the question: what makes an impossible figure impossible? In this essay, we will explore the characteristics and conditions that define impossible figures and make them impossible. \n\nOne of the most well-known examples of an impossible figure is the Penrose Triangle, also known as the \"impossible triangle.\" This shape consists of three lines that appear to form a triangle, but when examined closely, it becomes clear that the angles and edges do not actually connect in any meaningful way. The Penrose Triangle is an example of an impossible figure because it violates the rule of continuity, meaning that the lines and shapes do not continue in a smooth, uninterrupted flow. \n\nContinuity is a critical condition for possible figures to exist. In geometry, continuity refers to the idea that lines and shapes must connect without any breaks or interruptions. An impossible figure breaks this rule by presenting lines and shapes that do not connect, creating a sense of disjointedness and confusion for the viewer. Impossible figures challenge our sense of spatial perception and force us to question the accuracy of our eyes and brains. \n\nAnother condition that defines an impossible figure is the rule of perspective. In art and design, perspective is a technique used to create the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality. In order for an object or image to appear three-dimensional, it must follow the laws of perspective, which dictate how objects appear to grow smaller and closer together as they move away from the viewer. Impossible figures challenge the rule of perspective by creating shapes and lines that do not conform to these laws. \n\nThe concept of angle in relation to impossible figures is also a significant factor that contributes to their impossible nature. Impossible figures often have strange and confusing angles that defy traditional geometric principles. The angles in impossible figures do not add up to 180 degrees, leading to a sense of disorientation and confusion for the viewer. This characteristic of impossible figures reflects an important aspect of human perception: we are naturally inclined to see patterns and consistencies in the objects and shapes around us. Impossible figures disrupt this natural inclination by breaking the patterns and consistencies that we expect to see.\n\nFurthermore, impossible figures often rely on the use of negative space and ambiguity to create their effect. Negative space refers to the area around and between shapes, and it can be used to create interesting and visually appealing designs. In impossible figures, however, negative space is used to create confusion and distortion. By exploiting the ambiguity of negative space, impossible figures create illusions that appear to bend and twist in ways that are impossible in reality. \n\nThe cultural and historical context of impossible figures is also an important factor to consider when examining their impossible nature. Impossible figures have been a popular subject in art and design for many centuries, with examples dating back to ancient Greek and Roman art. In contemporary culture, impossible figures have become a staple of science fiction and fantasy media, appearing in movies, TV shows, and video games. The popularity of impossible figures in popular media reflects our enduring fascination with the impossible and the unknown. \n\nIn conclusion, impossible figures are a unique and intriguing phenomenon that challenges our understanding of geometry, perspective, and perception. By violating the rules of continuity, perspective, and angle, impossible figures create illusions that appear to be three-dimensional but cannot exist in reality. Additionally, the use of negative space and ambiguity contributes to the complex and confusing nature of these figures. While there is no single factor that makes an impossible figure impossible, it is the combination of these conditions and characteristics that creates the effect. The enduring popularity of impossible figures in art, design, and popular media reflects our fascination with the impossible and our desire to explore the limits of our perception and understanding.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe fall of Berlin in 1945 marked the end of World War II in Europe. With the Soviet Union closing in from the east and the Allied powers invading from the west, Hitler and his comrades were trapped in the German capital, surrounded by enemy forces. It is widely believed that Hitler committed suicide in his bunker as the Soviet army closed in, but there have been persistent rumors and conspiracy theories that he may have escaped the siege and fled to South America. So, was Hitler really able to escape the Berlin siege?\n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to understand the circumstances surrounding Hitler's last days in the bunker. On April 20, 1945, Hitler celebrated his 56th birthday in his bunker beneath Berlin. By this time, it was clear to Hitler that the war was lost and that the Allied powers would soon be victorious. However, he refused to surrender and instead chose to remain in Berlin, believing that he could still turn the tide of the war with his personal leadership.\n\nAs the Soviet army approached Berlin, Hitler became increasingly paranoid and delusional. He accused his generals of disloyalty and treason and ordered the execution of several high-ranking officers. By the end of April, Hitler realized that all hope was lost and that he would soon fall into the hands of the enemy. On April 30, 1945, Hitler committed suicide in his bunker, along with his newlywed wife, Eva Braun.\n\nDespite this well-documented account, there have been persistent rumors and conspiracy theories that Hitler did not die in Berlin but instead escaped to South America. The most popular theory is that Hitler fled to Argentina, where he lived out the rest of his life in seclusion. There have been countless alleged sightings of Hitler in South America over the years, along with claims that Nazi officials helped him to escape Germany and provided him with a new identity.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence to support these claims. In fact, there is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that Hitler died in Berlin on April 30, 1945. His body was discovered by Soviet soldiers in the ruins of the Reich Chancellery, where they found his remains alongside those of Eva Braun. The Soviets took the bodies back to Moscow, where they were examined by Soviet officials and identified as Hitler and Braun through dental records.\n\nIn addition to the physical evidence of Hitler's death, there are also eyewitness accounts from those who were in the bunker with him in his final days. These accounts come from individuals such as Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, and Hitler's chief of staff, General Wilhelm Keitel. Both men were with Hitler in the bunker on April 30, 1945, and witnessed his suicide. Their accounts have been corroborated by other witnesses and are considered to be highly reliable.\n\nFurthermore, it is unlikely that Hitler could have successfully escaped from Berlin. The city was heavily guarded by Soviet troops, and escape would have been difficult if not impossible. Additionally, Hitler was in poor health and suffering from Parkinson's disease, making it unlikely that he could have survived a grueling journey to South America.\n\nLastly, there is little motivation for Hitler to have fled to South America. While it is true that many Nazi officials did flee to countries such as Argentina and Brazil after the war, Hitler had no reason to do so. He was a wanted war criminal and would have been sought after by the Allies for the rest of his life. Furthermore, Hitler was a megalomaniac who believed that he would be remembered as one of the greatest leaders in history. It is unlikely that he would have chosen to live out his life in obscurity in South America rather than continuing to fight for his ideals.\n\nIn conclusion, there is little evidence to support the theory that Hitler escaped from the Berlin siege and fled to South America. The most likely scenario is that Hitler died in his bunker in Berlin on April 30, 1945, alongside his newlywed wife, Eva Braun. While conspiracy theories may persist, the overwhelming evidence points to Hitler's death in the final days of World War II.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nIn ancient Greece, there was a big difference between the lives of the rich and the poor. The rich had many luxuries, while the poor had to work hard just to survive. In this essay, we will explore the lives of the poor in archaic Greece.\n\nThe poor in ancient Greece were mainly farmers, who had to work hard to grow their crops. They had to work in fields that were small and not very fertile. They did not have the money to pay for better land or irrigation, which made it harder for them to grow crops. They also had to deal with harsh weather, such as droughts and floods. The poor often had to borrow money to buy seeds and tools, which put them in debt.\n\nIn addition to farming, the poor also had to work in other jobs, such as fishing or raising livestock. They had to sell their goods at the market in order to make money. However, because they did not have much to sell, they often did not get very much money in return. This meant that they had to work even harder to make ends meet.\n\nThe poor also had to deal with limited access to education. Only the rich could afford to send their children to school, so poor children had to work and help their parents instead. This meant that poor families often had less educated members, which made it even harder for them to improve their lives.\n\nFurthermore, the poor had limited access to healthcare. They often had to rely on home remedies or natural cures, because they could not afford to see a doctor. This made it harder for them to recover from illnesses and injuries, which meant they had to miss work and lose money.\n\nIn addition, the poor were often subject to exploitative practices. Wealthy landowners would hire poor farmers to work on their land, but pay them very little in return. They would also force the poor to pay high taxes and fees. This made it harder for the poor to save money or improve their standard of living.\n\nOverall, the lives of the poor in archaic Greece were very difficult. They had to work hard just to survive, and faced many challenges such as limited access to education and healthcare, exploitative practices, and harsh weather conditions. However, despite these challenges, the poor were able to persevere and make the best of their situations.\n\nOne way that the poor were able to overcome their challenges was through community support. Poor families would often band together to help each other in times of need. For example, they would share tools and seeds, or help each other build homes. This sense of community was essential for the poor to survive in harsh conditions.\n\nAnother way that the poor were able to overcome their challenges was through religion. They believed that the gods could help them in times of need, so they would offer sacrifices and prayers to them. This gave them a sense of hope and purpose, which helped them to face their challenges with more courage.\n\nIn conclusion, the lives of the poor in archaic Greece were very difficult. They had to work hard just to survive, and faced many challenges such as limited access to education and healthcare, exploitative practices, and harsh weather conditions. However, despite these challenges, the poor were able to persevere and make the best of their situations. They relied on community support and their religious beliefs to help them overcome their challenges. While the lives of the poor in ancient Greece were not ideal, they were able to find ways to thrive despite their difficult circumstances.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nIn his book “Go For The Juggler,” Nigel Roth argues that we often hold ourselves back by playing it safe and not taking risks. He encourages readers to embrace their fears, take chances, and pursue their dreams with full force. Roth believes that going for the jugular – going all out and giving it everything we’ve got – is the key to achieving greatness in life.\n\nRoth’s message is both inspiring and challenging. It speaks to our innate desire for success and fulfillment, but it also forces us to confront our own limitations and self-doubt. In this essay, I will explore Roth’s ideas and reflect on how they apply to my own life.\n\nFirst and foremost, Roth emphasizes the importance of embracing fear. He argues that fear is a natural part of the human experience and that we shouldn’t try to avoid it, but rather use it as a source of motivation. Fear can push us to take risks and step outside of our comfort zones. Roth writes, “Fear can either paralyze us or propel us forward. The choice is ours.”\n\nAs I reflect on this idea, I can see how fear has held me back in the past. There have been times when I’ve wanted to try something new or pursue a passion, but I’ve held back because I was afraid of failure or rejection. I can think of one instance in particular where I was considering applying for a competitive internship, but I talked myself out of it because I didn’t think I was qualified. Looking back, I realize that my fear of rejection was irrational and that I missed out on an amazing opportunity because of it.\n\nRoth’s advice to embrace fear is easier said than done, but I believe it’s an essential part of personal growth. By acknowledging our fears and using them as motivation, we can push ourselves to achieve more than we ever thought possible.\n\nAnother key idea in “Go For The Juggler” is the importance of taking bold action. Roth argues that we shouldn’t settle for mediocrity or play it safe, but rather go all out and give it everything we’ve got. He writes, “Success is not for those who play it safe. Success is for those who take bold action, who push the limits, and who refuse to settle for anything less than greatness.”\n\nAs I reflect on this idea, I can see how it applies to many areas of my life. In school, I often find myself settling for good grades instead of striving for excellence. I’m hesitant to speak up in class or challenge myself with difficult assignments because I’m afraid of failure. However, Roth’s message reminds me that true success requires taking bold action and pushing past our limitations.\n\nIt’s easy to get comfortable with the status quo and settle for less than we are capable of. However, Roth argues that this mindset will never lead to true success or fulfillment. Instead, we need to push ourselves to take risks and pursue our passions with full force.\n\nOne aspect of “Go For The Juggler” that I found particularly helpful is Roth’s emphasis on persistence. He acknowledges that pursuing our dreams is never easy and that we will inevitably face setbacks and obstacles along the way. However, he encourages readers to keep pushing forward and never give up on our goals. Roth writes, “Success is not achieved by those who give up at the first sign of difficulty. Success is achieved by those who persist, who persevere, and who refuse to quit.”\n\nAs someone who struggles with perfectionism and giving up easily, I find this message particularly inspiring. It’s easy to become discouraged when things don’t go according to plan or when we face obstacles in pursuing our goals. However, Roth’s message reminds me that persistence is key to achieving success. Instead of giving up, we need to keep pushing forward and find new ways to overcome challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, “Go For The Juggler” by Nigel Roth offers readers a powerful message of motivation and inspiration. By embracing our fears, taking bold action, and persisting in the face of obstacles, we can achieve greatness in our lives. As I reflect on Roth’s ideas, I can see how they apply to my own life and the ways in which I’ve held myself back in the past. However, I also feel inspired to push past my limitations and pursue my passions with renewed enthusiasm and determination. In short, “Go For The Juggler” is a must-read for anyone looking to achieve their full potential in life.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAs we know, paintings are a form of art that has been present for hundreds of years. They are created to convey messages in many forms, such as emotions, ideas, and stories. Moving forward, we will be discussing one of the most renowned paintings of all time, A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat, and how to read it.\n\nA Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte is an oil painting that was created in 1884-1886. It is an example of post-impressionistic art, a movement that rejected the naturalism of impressionism in favor of a more self-conscious form of art, concerned with the manipulation of form, color, and line. Spread across 7' 10'' x 10' 1\/4 \", the painting is massive and depicts people from all walks of life.\n\nLooking closer at the painting, we see several people sitting on the grassy banks of the Seine River enjoying a leisurely Sunday afternoon. The scenery is painted in a pointillist style, using dots of color to create the image, which makes the painting seem vibrant and alive. The people depicted in the painting are typical Parisians from the 19th century in their elegant attire. The individuals depicted in the picture remain anonymous, and the painter focuses on their appearance, their role in the city's social hierarchy, and the activities they participate in.\n\nOne of the most striking features of the painting is the use of colors. Seurat used the color theory to create a harmonious balance between the colors used. The colors used also reflect the feeling of leisure and calmness that is present in the painting. The grass and trees are painted in different shades of green, creating a sense of relaxation and peace. The water is painted in blue, reflecting a serene, calm atmosphere. The clothing worn by the people is painted in different colors that complement each other, enhancing the overall aesthetics of the painting.\n\nApart from colors, the painting's composition is also noteworthy. The individuals in the painting are placed strategically to create a sense of symmetry and balance. The scene is divided into three parts- the people in the foreground, the middle ground, and the background. All the people sitting in the painting are facing the river, creating a sense of unity and shared experience. Furthermore, the painting's central point of interest is a woman who is sitting with her monkey, drawing our attention towards her and the activities she is doing.\n\nFinally, the different objects and symbols used in the painting have meaning. The umbrellas used in the painting symbolize the social status of the people sitting under them. The woman in the foreground with her monkey is a reference to the exoticism that was prevalent in 19th-century Paris. The picture also features several boats sailing on the Seine River, symbolic of trade, commerce, and Paris's urban life.\n\nIn conclusion, reading a painting requires a keen eye to see the details and symbols in the painting. A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte is an excellent example of a post-impressionistic painting, featuring a harmonious balance of color, composition, and symbolism. It is a painting that transports us into the leisurely world of 19th-century Paris, a world far different from ours, yet equally captivating.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"To see one of the most remarkable objects in the Bay Area, drop by Fire Station #6 in Livermore — and knock on the front door. (Actually, these are Covid-19 times, so probably best to call ahead). A weary fireman will answer, and if things are quiet and the hour is reasonable, he’ll let you in.\n\nAside from the normal giant red trucks and array of neatly-coiled hoses you’d find in any firehouse, what makes Fire Station #6 special? A lightbulb. Specifically, the Centennial Lightbulb, which has been burning since 1901, making it the longest burning bulb in history.\n\nThis strange, small bulb is in the Guinness Book of World Records, has been recognized by Ripley’s Believe it or Not, and has received declarations from the President of the United States, Congress, various senators, the California state assembly, and more. Former President George W Bush said that the bulb is “an enduring symbol of the American spirit of invention” and the California Senate called the bulb’s firehouse home a “historical shrine.”\n\nThe Centennial Bulb was originally installed in 1901 at a firehouse on L street. It was moved several times over the course of the city’s history, often accompanied by a full parade and police escort. The bulb runs on standard 110-volt power but is connected to a special power supply to keep it running even if there’s a power outage. It’s gone off a few times — most recently in 2013 — but save for these short outages, the bulb has burned continuously for 120 years.\n\nI visited the Centennial Bulb in May of 2019. The bulb itself hangs from the high ceilings of the firehouse, giving off a gentle glow. It originally burned at 60 watts — about the same as a modern lightbulb — but faded to around 4 watts over time. It looks a bit like the hanging globe lights which have become popular during the pandemic, or the exposed filament lights you might find in a hipster coffee shop. The bulb is accompanied by a small historical exhibit on its installation, life and local history.\n\nWhy has the bulb burned for so long?\n\nThe bulb was made by the Shelby Electric Company. It has a carbon filament and a hand-blown glass enclosure. The main theory as to why it has burned so long is that the bulb was extremely high quality when it was initially made. That sets it in contrast to the incandescent bulbs of today, which usually burn out in a few years.\n\nThe bulb has burned through two World Wars, the entirety of the 1918 flu pandemic, the Great Depression, the Summer of Love, the birth of the Internet, and much else. During a year that has felt tumultuous and unpredictable, it’s comforting to know that the Centennial Bulb has been there with us the whole time, quietly burning.\n\n\/\/ Firehouse Six is located at 4550 East Ave., Livermore, California. You can try to drop by, or call (925) 454–2361 to ask about a visit. If you can’t make it to Livermore or the firehouse is too busy to accommodate your visit, you can always see the Centennial Bulb online, via its dedicated bulb cam.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Pecola Breedlove has haunted me for most of my life.\n\nI was 12 years old when I first read The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison’s first published novel. I had never heard of Morrison; I didn’t know I was reading a masterwork from the greatest American writer of all time. I didn’t know anything about Morrison’s racial, sexual or gender politics, or about how she centered women like her — like me — in her work. I didn’t know that I would hear Morrison’s voice in my head for years and years afterwards.\n\nAnd I didn’t know that Pecola Breedlove — the young Black girl at the center of that tumultuous, painful tale — would become ingrained in my mind and in my spirit. I just knew that I’d seen a book in a library that looked interesting. So, I picked it up.\n\nThroughout The Bluest Eye, Pecola is brutally punished for being a dark-skinned Black girl. The very minute Pecola is born, her mother decides that her dark skin makes her an ugly child, and every experience in Pecola’s life reinforces her mother’s judgement. She faces constant emotional, physical and sexual abuse from classmates, neighbors and her family. Pecola grows to believe that she had blue eyes — if she had any way to indicate that she is not the Black ugly child they’ve told her she is — she would be free of all of the torment.\n\nI remember thinking that Pecola was cursed, but not because she was dark-skinned with brown eyes. She was cursed because her community had branded her, and that brand would never fade. Her classmates, the nasty man down the street, her mother, her father — they had all decided what she was, and she could never escape that.\n\nBlue eyes could never save Pecola. Nothing could save Pecola. She didn’t stand a chance.\n\nThe Bluest Eye, like most of Morrison’s work, is engrossing, emotionally draining, incredibly complex and overwhelming. My 12-year-old self did not have the capacity to fully grasp what I was reading. I had an elementary-level understanding of race, anti-blackness and colorism; I understood what it was to be Black, to be hated and discriminated against for being Black, and that being dark-skinned made you a target for even more hate, this time from your own people. I knew that much, at least. But I know that I couldn’t I truly understand how much children — my age and younger — internalized these concepts. I didn’t realize how deeply it could scar us.\n\nBut my 12-year-old self knew Pecola Breedlove, because I knew what it meant to be “ugly.” To be called “ugly”, to be seen as “ugly”, to be deemed “ugly”. I knew the abuse that came with that “ugly” label, that both children and adults are often their worst selves when dealing with people they’ve deemed undesirable or unfit in some way. I had that label: it was stitched onto me by people in my life — grown folks, too — who saw the extra weight on my stomach, arms and legs, the way my nose spread and the spaces in my teeth and thought “ugly” was the only way to describe me.\n\nAs an adult, I could read The Bluest Eye and understand Morrison’s commentary on internalized anti-blackness, colorism and childhood sexual abuse. I could discuss the politics of that novel all I wanted to, but it didn’t mitigate the pain I felt on Pecola’s behalf. It didn’t stop the flashbacks to my own childhood, to the young girl who understood Pecola before she had a handle on the terminology we use to describe The Bluest Eye.\n\nAt the end of the day, Pecola Breedlove is a real little girl. She exists in our communities. We abuse her, bully her. We use her skin and her body to serve us in ways that degrade her. Then we push her to the edge of town, out of our sight and out of our minds. We treat her as if she were a specter or a figment of our imaginations, as if she were not real.\n\nBut she is. I’ve seen her; not on the edge of town, but in my home, in my school. I saw her as a child, and then as a teenager and now as an adult. I cannot look away from her face, and the big, brown eyes that she desperately wanted to be blue. I cannot ignore the trauma that mangled Pecola. And that’s what Morrison wanted to accomplish by writing The Bluest Eye. Morrison wanted us to see Pecola Breedlove. She always wanted us to see the Black girls and women that our society tries to erase.\n\nI read more of Morrison’s work. Jazz, Beloved, God Help the Child and others, each one imprinting themselves onto my spirit in some way. There’s something truly awe-inspiring and frightening about the way Morrison’s words have shaped my life. Even as my understanding of her work deepened, I could never intellectualize the feeling it gave me. I could never shake the terror, the frustration, the trepidation, the sadness. They all follow me, stepping on the back of my heels as I walk. And The Bluest Eye — little Pecola — follows me the closest.\n\nI think that’s why Morrison’s death has hit me so hard. Morrison saw us in all our forms, and she made sure that everyone else saw us, too. She understood us in a way no one else ever can, and she didn’t concern herself with making us any less complicated.\n\nWhen I learned that Morrison died, I immediately thought of The Bluest Eye, and the lasting impact Morrison and Pecola Breedlove have had on me. I’ve barely been able to think of anything else. All of my attempts to verbalize that impact are pitiful. I could never really express what Morrison means to me. I can’t envision my life without Morrison’s work — without Pecola Breedlove and our shared pain. I am indebted to Toni Morrison. And I’m eternally grateful for her.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}

Many people visit the Eildon Hills for hiking, bird-watching or just to enjoy the breathtaking scenery. However, the hills are not just a place of fun and adventure. They can also be a source of pain and aching for those who dare to explore them.\n\nI remember a time when I visited the Eildon Hills with my family. We set out early in the morning, with excitement and anticipation in our hearts. As we started our ascent up Eildon Hill East, I remember feeling so alive and free. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the scenery was stunning. We took our time as we climbed higher and higher, stopping every now and then to take photos and catch our breaths. It was a great adventure, and we were all having the time of our lives.\n\nHowever, as we reached the summit of Eildon Hill East, I started to feel a sharp pain in my right ankle. I tried to ignore it at first, thinking it was just a minor ache that would go away with time. But as we continued our hike towards Eildon Hill North, the pain only grew worse. It was like a stabbing sensation that shot up my leg every time I took a step. It was becoming unbearable, and I knew that I wouldn't be able to continue much longer.\n\nMy parents noticed that something was wrong, and they asked me what was going on. I tried to brush it off, but they could see the pain in my face. They sat me down and took a look at my ankle. It was swollen and red, and it hurt to touch it. They knew that we couldn't continue the hike, and that I needed to rest.\n\nWe sat there for a while, enjoying the view and the fresh air. My parents gave me some water and a snack, hoping that it would help ease the pain. We talked about how beautiful the hills were, and how lucky we were to be able to experience it all. I felt better just being there, surrounded by nature and my family.\n\nAfter a while, my parents decided that we needed to head back down the hill. My ankle was still hurting, and we didn't want to risk making it worse. We slowly made our way back down the hill, taking breaks every now and then to rest. It was a long and painful journey, but we made it back to our car in the end. My ankle was still sore, but I was glad that we had made it back safely.\n\nLooking back on that day, I realized that the Eildon Hills may be beautiful, but they can also be dangerous if you're not careful. It's important to wear the right shoes and clothing, to stay hydrated, and to take breaks when needed. You never know what may happen when you're out exploring nature, so it's better to be prepared.\n\nSince that day, I've been back to the Eildon Hills many times. Each time, I'm amazed by how beautiful they are, and how much they have to offer. I've learned to be more careful and to listen to my body. If something doesn't feel right, it's better to take a break and rest. The last thing you want is to get injured and ruin your day.\n\nIn conclusion, the Eildon Hills are a beautiful and enchanting place to explore. They offer stunning views, fresh air, and a chance to connect with nature. However, they can also be a source of pain and aching if you're not careful. It's important to be prepared, stay safe, and listen to your body. With the right precautions, you can have an amazing time in the Eildon Hills, without any aches or pains.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAs the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, people have been forced to stay at home, with limited social interaction, and most leisure activities out of bounds. In such moments, movies and TV series have played significant roles in keeping people entertained and distracted from the harsh realities of the pandemic. One such series is Spawn, an American superhero-action television series that ran from 1997 to 1999. \n\nSpawn follows the story of Al Simmons, a former Marine and CIA agent, who is betrayed and killed by his boss, Jason Wynn, and sent to hell. After making a deal with the devil, he returns to earth five years after his death, and discovers that his wife, Wanda, is now married to his best friend, Terry Fitzgerald. Simmons also finds that he has been transformed into a demonic creature with supernatural abilities, which he uses to fight crime, avenge his death, and protect the city from evil forces.\n\nSince its release, Spawn has received mixed reviews from audiences and critics alike. However, the show's themes and characters resonate with the current state of the world during the quarantine period. The show's portrayal of Al Simmons emphasizes the importance of the human body and its connection to our identity and purpose. \n\nThe body is at the center of Spawn's story, as it is both the means and the end of Al Simmons' transformation. After his death, Simmons' body is transformed into a demonic creature, which he uses to fulfill his mission on earth. This transformation makes him powerful, but it also separates him from his human identity and his connection to his wife and friend. Simmons' transformation highlights the importance of the human body and its connection to our identity and purpose. \n\nDuring the quarantine period, many people have been forced to face the limitations and fragility of their bodies. The pandemic has exposed the human body's vulnerability to disease and death, and many people have had to confront their own mortality. This has made people more aware of the importance of taking care of their bodies and maintaining their health. \n\nThe importance of the body is also emphasized in the show's treatment of its female characters. The show features several female characters, including Wanda, Cyan, and Angela. Wanda is portrayed as a strong, independent woman who is fiercely loyal to her husband, Terry. However, her character is also objectified and sexualized, with several scenes emphasizing her curves and beauty. Similarly, Cyan, a young girl whom Simmons befriends, is portrayed as innocent and vulnerable, and her appearance is often fetishized. Angela, a warrior angel who is tasked with hunting down Simmons, is portrayed as powerful and skilled, but her appearance is also sexualized.\n\nThese portrayals of female characters highlight the tension between the body as a source of power and the body as an object of desire. The show's female characters are both empowered and objectified, reflecting the contradictory attitudes towards women's bodies in our society. During the quarantine period, women have also faced unique challenges as they navigate their bodies' changes and limitations. Many women have had to contend with the physical and emotional toll of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood, while also juggling work and family responsibilities. \n\nThe show's portrayal of Al Simmons and his transformation also raises questions about identity and purpose. After his transformation, Simmons struggles to reconcile his demonic identity with his human past. He is haunted by memories of his life as a human and his relationships with Wanda, Terry, and his daughter, Cyan. Simmons' transformation highlights the importance of identity and purpose, and the challenges that arise when these are disrupted or transformed. \n\nDuring the quarantine period, many people have also had to grapple with questions about their identity and purpose. The pandemic has disrupted many people's lives, forcing them to adapt to new circumstances and challenges. This has led many people to question their priorities, values, and goals and to reassess their relationship to themselves and to others. In this sense, the show's treatment of identity and purpose resonates with the current state of the world, where many people are struggling to find meaning and direction in uncertain times.\n\nIn conclusion, Spawn is a complex and thought-provoking show that raises important questions about the human body, identity, and purpose. The show's portrayal of Al Simmons and his transformation highlights the importance of the body and its connection to our identity and purpose. The tension between the body as a source of power and the body as an object of desire is also reflected in the show's treatment of its female characters. During the quarantine period, these themes and characters resonate with the challenges and uncertainties that people are facing as they adapt to new circumstances and grapple with questions about their lives and relationships. Ultimately, Spawn is a show that reminds us of the importance of the body, our relationships, and the challenges and opportunities that arise when these are disrupted or transformed.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nOversimplified ML (3): Outputs\n\nIn the realm of machine learning, outputs refer to the end results produced by a model after being trained on a dataset. These outputs can take many different forms, depending on the type of problem being addressed and the specific algorithms utilized. In this essay, we will explore some of the most common output types and their implications.\n\nClassification outputs are one of the most intuitive output types. In classification problems, the goal is to predict a categorical label based on input data. For example, a model might be trained to classify images of animals as belonging to specific species. The output of such a model would be a categorical label indicating the predicted species for the input image. This type of output is useful in a wide range of applications, from disease diagnosis in medical imaging to spam filtering in email.\n\nRegression outputs are another common type of output. In regression problems, the goal is to predict a continuous value rather than a categorical label. For example, a model might be trained to predict the temperature at a given time based on historical weather data. The output of such a model would be a numerical value representing the predicted temperature. Regression outputs can be used in a wide range of applications, from stock price prediction to traffic flow forecasting.\n\nClustering outputs are a bit more abstract than classification and regression. In clustering problems, the goal is to group similar data points together based on their features. The output of a clustering model is a set of clusters, each containing similar data points. Clustering is useful when dealing with large amounts of data, as it can help identify patterns and groupings that might not be immediately apparent otherwise.\n\nAnomaly detection outputs are another type of output that can be used in a variety of applications. In anomaly detection problems, the goal is to identify data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset. The output of an anomaly detection model is a binary label that indicates whether a given data point is an outlier or not. This type of output is useful in a wide range of applications, from fraud detection to network intrusion detection.\n\nGenerative outputs are a bit different from the other output types we’ve discussed. In generative problems, the goal is to create new data that is similar to the input data. For example, a generative model might be trained on a dataset of handwritten digits and then used to generate new handwritten digits that are similar to the ones in the dataset. The output of a generative model is a new data point that is not part of the original dataset. Generative models can be used in a wide range of applications, from image and audio synthesis to language translation.\n\nIn conclusion, machine learning outputs can take many different forms, depending on the problem being addressed and the specific algorithms utilized. Classification outputs are used to predict categorical labels, while regression outputs are used to predict continuous values. Clustering outputs identify groups of similar data points, while anomaly detection outputs identify outliers. Generative outputs create new data that is similar to the input data. By understanding these different types of outputs, we can better appreciate the complex and diverse nature of machine learning.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nYes the Body: A Quarantined Review of Spawn \n\nSpawn is a comic book character that has been around since the 90s. He is a demon who was once a man named Al Simmons. Al made a deal with the devil to come back to life after he died. But after he came back, he realized that he was given powers to do the devil's dirty work. He then decided to use his powers to fight for justice.\n\nI recently read the first issue of Spawn, and I have to say, I was a little scared at first. The cover showed a creepy-looking demon with red eyes, horns, and a black cape. But I was also curious to know more about this character that everyone talks about.\n\nThe story starts with Al Simmons waking up in a dark alley. He is confused and doesn't remember much about his past. As he walks around the city, he realizes that something is wrong. He can see demons and angels fighting each other, and he can also see people being attacked by monsters.\n\nAl meets a guy named Cogliostro who tells him that he is now a demon, and he has been given powers to fight for good. But he also warns Al that he has to be careful as there are other demons who want to destroy him.\n\nThe artwork in Spawn is amazing. It's dark and gritty, but it also has a lot of detail. The characters are drawn in a way that makes them look like they are alive. The colors used in the comic are mostly dark, which gives it a creepy feeling.\n\nThe writing in Spawn is also great. It's dark and moody, but it also has a sense of humor. The dialogues between the characters are natural and flow smoothly. The story itself is also very interesting. It's not just about a demon fighting other demons. There's also a mystery surrounding Al's past, which makes the story more engaging.\n\nOne thing that stood out for me in Spawn was the violence. There are a lot of scenes where people are being killed, and there's a lot of blood. It's not something that I'm used to seeing in comic books. But I think it adds to the overall mood of the story.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed was the use of nudity in Spawn. There are a few scenes where female characters are shown without clothes. It's not something that bothered me, but I can see how it might be inappropriate for younger readers.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed reading Spawn. It's not a comic book that I would recommend to everyone, but it's definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of dark and gritty stories.\n\nDuring this quarantine period, I have had ample time to read different books, watch movies and play games. As much as I enjoy doing all those things, I have developed a love for comics. Spawn is one of the comics that I have read, and I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed. I decided to read more on this character, and I must say that the more I read, the more I fell in love with the story.\n\nSpawn's abilities are really cool. He has the power to shapeshift, he can teleport, and he can even fly. He also has super strength and endurance, which makes him almost invincible in battle. But what I like most about Spawn is his moral code. Even though he is a demon, he fights for good. He protects the innocent and punishes the guilty.\n\nAnother interesting aspect of Spawn is his background story. Al Simmons was a special forces agent, and he was killed by his own boss. He then makes the deal with the devil to come back to life, but he realizes that he's been duped. Instead of being able to live a normal life, he's turned into a demon and given powers that he doesn't fully understand. But despite all of this, Al still fights for what's right. He's a tragic hero, and I can't help but root for him.\n\nThe villains in Spawn are also very interesting. The main villain is Malebolgia, who is the devil that Al made the deal with. He wants to use Spawn as a tool to take over the world. There are also other demons who want to kill Spawn and take his power for themselves. But what I find most interesting is that there are also angels who are fighting against the demons. It's not just good vs. evil. There are shades of gray in this story, and it's what makes it so compelling.\n\nThe art in Spawn is also really cool. Todd McFarlane, who created Spawn, is a talented artist. He has a unique style that's dark and creepy but also beautiful. The character designs are great, and the backgrounds and settings are also well-drawn. The art in Spawn is definitely one of its strongest assets.\n\nIn conclusion, I would highly recommend reading Spawn. It's not just a comic book about a demon fighting other demons. It's a story about a tragic hero who fights for what's right, even though he's been given powers that he doesn't fully understand. The art is amazing, and the writing is top-notch. However, due to the violence and nudity, I would recommend that younger readers have an adult with them while reading this comic book.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAdolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, is one of the most infamous figures in history. He inspired a genocide and set the world on a course for war, leading to the deaths of tens of millions of people. Although his life ended in 1945, there have always been rumors that he survived the Berlin Siege and escaped to South America or elsewhere. While there is no conclusive proof that this happened, there are several pieces of evidence that suggest that Hitler may have made it out of the city alive.\n\nTo understand this theory, it is important to examine the events that took place leading up to and during the Berlin Siege. In April of 1945, the Soviet army had encircled the city, making escape virtually impossible. Hitler, who was suffering from paranoia and delusions at the time, refused to flee the city or negotiate a surrender. Instead, he chose to remain in the city, directing his loyal followers in a doomed defense.\n\nAs the Soviet army closed in, Hitler retreated to his underground bunker, deep beneath the city. His top aides and generals were with him, including his mistress, Eva Braun. For several days, they attempted to manage the defense of the city and the army, but as the Soviet artillery began to rain down on the city, it became clear that the end was near.\n\nOn April 29th, Hitler married Eva Braun in the bunker. The next day, with the Soviet army only blocks away, Hitler dictated his last will and testament. In it, he spoke of his desire to commit suicide rather than be taken prisoner by the Soviets. He also appointed Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor, and named Joseph Goebbels as the new Reich Chancellor.\n\nThen, on April 30th, 1945, Adolf Hitler committed suicide. He shot himself in the head while Eva Braun took poison. According to contemporary reports, their bodies were then doused in gasoline and set on fire. Their remains were later discovered by Soviet troops, who buried them in an unmarked grave.\n\nBut did Hitler really die on that day in the bunker, as history tells us? There are several reasons to doubt the official story. First, there is no concrete evidence that Hitler’s remains were ever positively identified. The bodies that were found were badly burned and disfigured. While the Soviets claimed to have found dental records that matched Hitler’s, these records have never been produced or independently verified.\n\nSecond, there were many people in the bunker that day who claimed to have seen Hitler’s body, but there were also many who did not. Many of Hitler’s top aides and generals, including Heinrich Himmler and Hermann Göring, were not in the bunker when he died. Others who were there claim to have only seen the burned remains, not the body itself.\n\nThird, there are several accounts of people who claim to have seen Hitler after his supposed death. Some say they saw him escaping the bunker, while others claim he was spotted in various places around the world in the years following the end of World War II.\n\nSo, what happened to Hitler if he did, in fact, escape the siege? There are several theories. One popular theory is that he fled to South America, where he lived out the rest of his life in hiding. This theory is supported by several things, including the many Nazi sympathizers who fled to South America after the war, the number of Germans who emigrated there during the war, and the rumors that have persisted for decades that Hitler was living in Argentina or Brazil.\n\nAnother theory is that Hitler made it to Spain or Portugal, where he may have sought refuge with sympathizers. This theory is supported by reports that Hitler had connections in these countries, as well as rumors that he may have had a network of supporters who helped him escape.\n\nFinally, some people believe that Hitler may have made it to the Middle East, where he was said to have connections with Islamic leaders who sympathized with his cause. This theory is supported by reports that Hitler may have had connections with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini, who was a known supporter of the Nazis.\n\nRegardless of where Hitler may have gone, one thing is clear – if he did escape the Berlin Siege, he did so with the help of many people who were willing to risk their lives to help him. It is also clear that the story of Hitler’s death, which has now become part of history, is far from conclusive.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is no definitive proof that Adolf Hitler survived the Berlin Siege, there are many reasons to doubt the official story of his death. Whether he escaped to South America, Spain, or the Middle East, it is clear that many people were willing to help him escape and start a new life. As time goes on and new evidence emerges, we may one day learn the truth about what really happened to Hitler in his final days.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nSeventy-five years ago, the world witnessed one of the most iconic events of the 20th century: the Normandy landings. On June 6th, 1944, Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, in what would become known as D-Day. This operation marked a turning point in World War II and ultimately led to the liberation of Europe from Nazi occupation. Today, seventy-five years on, we reflect on the events of that day and honor those who fought and died for the cause of freedom.\n\nThe Normandy landings were the result of years of planning and preparation. Allied forces led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower had been working on a plan to invade Nazi-occupied Europe since the beginning of the war. The plan, codenamed Operation Overlord, called for the simultaneous landing of troops on five beaches across the Normandy coast. The goal was to establish a beachhead and quickly break out into the French countryside, cutting off German reinforcements and ultimately liberating Paris and the rest of Europe.\n\nThe operation was a massive undertaking, involving tens of thousands of troops, ships, and planes. The success of the operation relied on meticulous planning, coordination, and execution. The troops had to land at precisely the right time and place, and the naval and air support had to provide cover and suppress enemy fire. The challenges were numerous, including unpredictable weather, submerged obstacles, and heavily fortified German defenses.\n\nDespite the challenges, the Normandy landings were a resounding success. Allied forces managed to establish a foothold on the beaches, and within a few days, they were able to break out into the French countryside. The Germans were caught off guard by the scale and scope of the invasion, and they were unable to mount an effective defense. Allied forces were able to push the Germans back and secure their position in Normandy.\n\nThe Normandy landings were a turning point in the war, and their significance cannot be overstated. They marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany's reign of terror and paved the way for the liberation of Europe. They also represented a triumph of democracy over tyranny, freedom over oppression. The bravery and sacrifice of the troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy will never be forgotten.\n\nToday, seventy-five years on, we reflect on the lessons of Normandy and honor the sacrifices of those who fought and died for our freedoms. We must never forget the lessons of the past and the sacrifices of those who fought to preserve our way of life. We must continue to stand up for freedom and democracy, and we must never allow the forces of tyranny and oppression to gain a foothold in our world.\n\nIn the years following the Normandy landings, the world has changed dramatically. The Cold War, the rise of terrorism, and the emergence of new global powers have all shaped the world we live in today. However, the lessons of Normandy remain as relevant as ever. We must continue to fight for freedom and democracy, and we must never forget the sacrifices of those who fought to preserve them.\n\nThe legacy of Normandy is also a reminder of the power of international cooperation. The Normandy landings were the result of the collective effort of many nations, each contributing their troops, resources, and expertise. The success of the operation was due in large part to the ability of the allied forces to work together towards a common goal.\n\nToday, as we face new global challenges, we must remember the importance of international cooperation. We must work together to address issues such as climate change, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. We must also work to strengthen the institutions that promote peace and security, such as the United Nations and NATO.\n\nFinally, the Normandy landings are a reminder of the courage and sacrifice of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. The troops who stormed the beaches of Normandy knew that they were facing great danger, but they were willing to put their lives on the line for the cause of freedom. Their bravery and patriotism are an inspiration to us all, and we must always honor their sacrifice.\n\nIn conclusion, seventy-five years on, the Normandy landings remain a defining moment in world history. They marked a turning point in World War II and paved the way for the liberation of Europe. They also represent a triumph of democracy over tyranny, freedom over oppression. We must continue to remember the lessons of Normandy and honor the sacrifices of those who fought and died for our freedoms. We must also work together to promote international cooperation, strengthen institutions that promote peace and security, and honor the courage and sacrifice of our armed forces. As we look to the future, let us never forget the lessons of the past and let us continue to stand up for freedom and democracy.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"The Mysterious Legend of Bourbaki: Le Mathématicien Reclus\n\nDeception in a field that is meant to unravel reality\n\nToday, there is a book for almost anything and everything, and one can get access to any question at the turn of a page. However, whatever access we have to theory today has been made possible by the work of scientists over the last century, efforts which compounded over and yielded results.\n\nIf you were a high schooler in the earlier half of the 20th century, your access to even the most basic mathematical concepts was restricted due to the lack of authentic and quality knowledge.\n\nA fleet of mathematicians was killed in the First World War, fragmenting the field, causing a lack of a shared mathematical language, and making it extremely difficult to share work.\n\nMathematics was going through its second puberty, and it looked ugly.\n\nRise of a new leader\n\nIn the late 1930s, a mysterious new Mathematician took center stage in the world of Algebra.\n\nNo one knew how he looked, nor did they know where he lived or worked.\n\nThis elusive figure went by the obscure name of Dr. Nicolas Bourbaki and published ideas no expert had ever seen before.\n\nBourbaki miraculously published multitudes of book volumes under the banner Éléments de mathématique (Elements of Mathematics). Several research papers accompanied these volumes.\n\nWhile the rest of the world was busy hunting down who he was, Bourbaki kept on influencing mathematical theory with enormous rigor. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s publications became standard references.\n\nHe claimed to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet with his selected “collaborators”. He would communicate with the world via telegrams, whether it was to announce his daughter’s wedding or publicly insult anyone who doubted his existence.\n\nHe brought in the elements of structure, generality, formal proofing, and abstraction, in a field that had largely been intuitive until that point. Bourbaki’s increasing influence made influential mathematicians such as Benoit Mandelbrot flee from France, as their ideas were based solely on pictures.\n\nBourbaki forever changed the structure of modern mathematics.\n\nLike everything else in his life, his death was surrounded by an aura of mystery and deception. In 1968, the world received Bourbaki’s obituary, complete with mathematical puns.\n\nSeveral years after his death, the truth was finally outed. Nicolas Bourbaki wasn’t a man after all. He never existed. He was an imaginary figure created by a bunch of high schoolers, who started this as a prank to disrupt the status quo, for they were disappointed with the existing state of Mathematics.\n\nHow it was set up\n\nIn 1934, a French teenager had had enough. He’d been studying at the École Normale Supérieure and found his calculus book so disjointed, that he realized someone had to write a better one, or else “Math” would die.\n\nHe lobbied his friends and formed a small group to compose a new book. Henri Cartan, Claude Chevalley, Jean Delsarte, Jean Dieudonné, René de Possel, and André Weil were the founding members of this secret group.\n\nThey quickly hired new members and decided to publish Éléments de mathématique, and all their subsequent work, under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki, a Russian Mathematician.\n\nFunnily enough, they also fictionalized Bourbaki’s origin story. The story said the Russian mathematician Bourbaki met these young mathematicians in Paris.\n\nThe group would meet at the Café Capoulade for regular discussions. There was no leader. Everything they published had to have a unanimous agreement. Their passionate, heated discussions sought for rigorous, formal proof. There was no place for things like ‘intuition’ — abstraction and generality were necessary.\n\nTheir texts began with a set of simple axioms, laws, and assumptions. From there, they went on to derive complex theorems.\n\nThey gave new, clear definitions to some of the most important mathematical objects, including the function.\n\nTheir work allowed mathematicians to establish logic that could be translated across the function’s domains in both directions.\n\nTheir systematic approach to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic constrained creativity.\n\nThe legacy\n\nBourbaki Congress of 1938 (Source)\n\nDespite his apparent death, the group bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence is still very influential. Additionally, the modern emphasis on formal proof owes a great deal to his rigorous methods.\n\nNicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary — but his legacy is real.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThere are not many literary geniuses as well-known and celebrated as Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway. Both writers were recognized for their styles, unique voices, and accomplished works. So, it is not hard to imagine the excitement that was felt in 1959, when these two great minds met up for lunch in the Floridita, Cuba. This essay aims to explore the impact of the meeting between Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway, how their styles and themes were similar and divergent, and the general atmosphere of the 1950s and the flourishing Cuban culture.\n\nTennessee Williams is one of the most prominent playwrights and authors of the 20th century, a name that still resounds in the literary scene today. Williams' style is marked by his portrayal of characters' complexity, their interrelationships, and the delicate balance between their hopes and fears. Williams had a way of excavating the innermost feelings and motivations of his characters, revealing the common ground we share as humans. His works, such as \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,\" were significant contributions to American literature by rendering the human condition in all its aspects.\n\nErnest Hemingway, on the other hand, was a novelist who brought a new style to American literature. Hemingway's prose was sparse and clear, using simple language and eschewing flowery vocabulary. His works were characterized by the portrayal of masculine characters, often involved in outdoor activities, with much emphasis on violence, war, and their aftermath. Moreover, Hemingway was known for his use of the 'iceberg theory' of writing, where he presented only a fraction of the story and left a lot unsaid, so his readers were forced to infer and fill in the gaps.\n\nWhen Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway met, they were two different writers with different styles and themes. However, this meeting allowed them to find common ground and appreciate each other's works. They found similarities in their romanticized portrayal of Cuba and the Caribbean, which served as a haven for both writers. Moreover, they found common themes in their writing, such as the focus on human relationships and the exploration of the human psyche, particularly the interior monologue of their protagonists.\n\nSome critics contend that Hemingway's masculinity and Williams' effeminacy were conflicting ideas. However, their meeting portrayed how writers can respect and appreciate each other, despite their differences. Hemingway's take on war and mental breakdowns may have been different from Williams' depiction of complex, emotionally vulnerable characters. However, their interests in humanity and its complexities were intertwined, and their meeting in the Floridita served as a testament to that. Artists, like writers, are not stagnant and static, but constantly evolving and experimenting. Thus, in their meeting, Williams and Hemingway were able to appreciate the diversities in each other's works and be open to new ways of looking at the world and portraying it in their writing.\n\nThe meeting between Williams and Hemingway transpired during the 1950s, a decade characterized by social, political, and cultural change. The post-World War II era was a time of upheaval, where writers grappled with the new realities of the world. The writers in the 1950s were opposed to the conventional, conservative values of the previous generation, a movement that served as a precursor to the 1960s, an era of subversive cultural revolution. Writers in the 1950s, like Williams and Hemingway, were advocates of individualism, incorporating social justice in their themes and making their works more accessible to wider audiences. \n\nThe meeting between these two giants of American literature was also set in Cuba, a country in the midst of its own revolution. The 1950s were a flourishing time for Cuban culture, with many artists and writers making Havana their permanent home. The country was a haven for writers, musicians, and artists looking for a retreat from the conservative, staid society back home. For writers like Williams and Hemingway, Cuba provided a space for them to explore their creativity and portray their unique visions through their works. The Floridita, where they met, was not only a restaurant, but a cultural hub where writers, artists, and musicians converged, sharing their ideas and works with each other.\n\nIn conclusion, the meeting between Tennessee Williams and Ernest Hemingway in the Floridita, Cuba, in 1959 was a momentous event, bringing together two of the greatest minds in American literature. The meeting allowed them to appreciate each other's works, despite their different styles and themes. The decade of the 1950s was a time of change and upheaval, marked by social and cultural revolution, where writers like Williams and Hemingway found their footing in the literary scene. The atmosphere of Cuba provided a haven for artists, making it a cultural hub where creative people converged to share their works and ideas. The meeting between Williams and Hemingway was a testament to how writers could respect and appreciate each other, despite their differences, and how they continue to evolve and experiment in their craft.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nSilicon Valley is a term used to describe the region of Northern California in the United States that has become a hub for global technology innovation. Today, Silicon Valley is synonymous with names like Apple, Intel, Google, and Facebook, but its history dates back to the early 20th century.\n\nThe development of Silicon Valley began with the establishment of Stanford University in 1885. The university was founded with the goal of creating a center of scientific research and development, and it quickly became a magnet for talented scientists and engineers.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that the region truly began to flourish. The post-World War II era saw a surge in technological developments, including the transistor, which would prove to be a game-changer for the industry.\n\nIn 1956, a group of eight scientists left Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory in search of better working conditions. They founded Fairchild Semiconductor, which would go on to become one of the most important companies in the history of Silicon Valley.\n\nFairchild Semiconductor was responsible for a number of groundbreaking innovations, including the first planar transistor and the first integrated circuit. These developments paved the way for the creation of modern electronics, and they helped give Silicon Valley its reputation as a center of innovation.\n\nHowever, the success of Fairchild Semiconductor also had another, more unexpected consequence. Many of the company's employees went on to found their own start-ups, often located nearby in the surrounding area of Santa Clara County.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as \"spin-off\" entrepreneurship, quickly became one of the defining characteristics of Silicon Valley. As more and more companies were founded, the area saw a rapid influx of talented engineers, scientists, and entrepreneurs.\n\nPerhaps the most famous of these start-ups was a small company founded by two friends in a garage in 1976. That company was Apple Inc., and the friends were Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.\n\nApple initially focused on producing personal computers, but it quickly became clear that the company was capable of much more. The introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 cemented Apple's reputation as a pioneer in the technology industry, and the company's influence has only continued to grow over the decades since.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, new companies continued to emerge in Silicon Valley at a breakneck pace. Microsoft, Oracle, and Sun Microsystems were just a few of the many firms that helped establish the region as a global center of innovation.\n\nIn recent years, Silicon Valley has continued to evolve and grow. The development of smartphones and other mobile devices has only increased the demand for new technologies, and the region has seen a surge in companies working on cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality.\n\nDespite this growth, however, Silicon Valley still retains much of its original character. The emphasis on innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking that defined the region in its early days remains just as strong today.\n\nIn conclusion, the history of Silicon Valley spans over a century, and it is one of the most remarkable stories of innovation and entrepreneurship in modern times. From the establishment of Stanford University to the founding of companies like Fairchild Semiconductor and Apple, Silicon Valley has been at the forefront of technological developments throughout its history. With the continued growth of new technologies, it seems likely that the region will remain one of the most important centers of innovation in the world.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nWhy America Banned Pre-Sliced Bread\n\nPre-sliced bread is a popular food item in the United States. Almost every grocery store sells pre-sliced bread. However, this was not the case in the early 1940s. During that time, pre-sliced bread was banned in America for a brief period. In this essay, we will discuss why America banned pre-sliced bread.\n\nThe ban on pre-sliced bread began on January 18, 1943. The reason behind this ban was that the government wanted to conserve resources during World War II. The government wanted to save the resources that went into the making of bread. Slicing bread was a wasteful process because it caused more bread to go stale faster. The government thought that by banning pre-sliced bread, consumers would be forced to buy whole bread instead of sliced, which would eventually lead to less bread waste.\n\nConsumers were unhappy about the ban because they had to slice bread themselves, and it was a time-consuming process. People did not want to spend extra time slicing bread. The government received complaints from people who said that the ban made their lives more difficult.\n\nHowever, the ban did not last long. Eighty-one days after it began, the ban on pre-sliced bread was lifted. The reason behind this was simple: the ban did not have the desired effect. Instead of saving bread, the ban led to more bread waste. People bought more bread than they needed, which resulted in more bread going stale faster. The ban did not save resources. It wasted them.\n\nIn addition to wasting resources, the ban on pre-sliced bread also had a negative effect on the economy. Bakeries that specialized in pre-sliced bread lost money during the ban. The ban meant that they had to stop producing pre-sliced bread, which they had built their business around. This led to a decrease in sales, which, in turn, led to layoffs. In some cases, bakeries had to shut down completely.\n\nThe ban on pre-sliced bread also had a negative effect on consumers. People did not want to be inconvenienced by having to slice bread themselves, and they were willing to pay more for pre-sliced bread. However, pre-sliced bread was not available during the ban. This meant that people had to buy whole bread, which was not only inconvenient, but also more expensive. This put a strain on people's budgets, especially those who were already struggling financially.\n\nIn conclusion, America banned pre-sliced bread during World War II to conserve resources. However, the ban proved to be unsuccessful, as it led to more bread waste and had negative effects on both the economy and consumers. The ban was lifted after 81 days, and pre-sliced bread became available again. The ban on pre-sliced bread is a reminder that even well-intentioned policies can have unintended consequences. Today, we take pre-sliced bread for granted, but it is important to remember its history and the role it played during World War II.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the famous French painter who was born on November 24, 1864, in Albi, France, was a man of many talents. He was known for his unique style and love of nightlife. Toulouse-Lautrec was a friend of the famous French painter and model Suzanne Valadon. This essay explores the life and works of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as a reflection of his unique personality and artistic style.\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec was a man of small stature due to a genetic condition. Despite his physical limitations, he was a prolific painter, printmaker, and illustrator. His passion for art started at an early age. He was born into an aristocratic family who encouraged his artistic interests. They provided him with the best education, including a degree in art at the age of 18.\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's style was influenced by the Impressionist painters of his time. He was particularly fond of Edgar Degas and Édouard Manet. His paintings were characterized by bold, bright colors, and the use of thick brushstrokes. He was also known for his ability to capture the essence of his subjects, from the famous cabaret performers to the prostitutes who worked in the Parisian red-light district of Montmartre.\n\nOne of his most notable works is the poster for the Moulin Rouge, which he created in 1891. The poster features a can-can dancer, dressed in a bright green costume, with a black top hat and stockings. The vibrant colors and bold lines of the poster captured the essence of the cabaret scene, which was a popular pastime in Paris during the late 19th century.\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's love of nightlife and his fascination with the people who frequented it were evident in his works. He was a regular patron of the Moulin Rouge, where he would often socialize with the performers and other patrons. He became friends with many of the cabaret performers, including Jane Avril, who was a muse for many of his works.\n\nHe was also friends with the famous painter and model, Suzanne Valadon. Valadon was a fellow resident of Montmartre, and the two shared a mutual interest in art. Valadon was a model for many of Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings, including \"The Hangover\" and \"Reine de Joie.\" Despite the lack of romantic involvement between the two, their friendship was an essential part of their artistic success.\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's fascination with the people of Montmartre led him to produce several works depicting the district's prostitutes. His work was considered controversial at the time, as it was seen as a reflection of the darker side of Parisian life. However, his ability to capture the essence of his subjects, along with his unique style, made his work memorable.\n\nOne of his most famous works depicting the prostitutes of Montmartre is the painting \"At the Moulin Rouge.\" The painting features several people, including a prostitute, a patron, and a can-can dancer. The use of bright colors and the thick brushstrokes make the painting come alive. The painting was also notable for its composition, which features several different subjects who are all connected in one way or another.\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's love of nightlife and his fascination with the people of Montmartre were not just limited to his paintings. He also created several lithographs and posters featuring cabaret performers, most notably Jane Avril. His lithographs were widely popular, and some of them are now considered iconic.\n\nIn conclusion, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was a unique artist who captured the essence of Parisian nightlife through his paintings, lithographs, and posters. His love of nightlife and fascination with the people of Montmartre led him to produce some of the most iconic works of the late 19th century. His friendship with Suzanne Valadon was an integral part of his artistic success. Toulouse-Lautrec's unique style, which combined bold colors and thick brushstrokes, made him one of the most memorable painters of his time. His legacy lives on as one of the most iconic painters of the late 19th century, and his works continue to inspire artists to this day.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}

{"prompt":"\n\nThe division of labour has long been a topic of discussion in various fields of study. It is a term that refers to the separation of tasks and responsibilities in a society, organization, or industry. The division of labour has been studied by economists, sociologists, and philosophers to understand its impact on efficiency, productivity, and social inequality.\n\nAccording to Adam Smith, the father of modern economics, the division of labour is the key driver of economic growth and success. Smith argued that by breaking down tasks into smaller, specialized parts, workers could become more efficient and productive. This, in turn, would lead to lower costs and higher profits for businesses, which would then stimulate economic growth.\n\nSmith's ideas were revolutionary at the time, and they continue to shape the way we organize work and production today. We can see the division of labour in action in almost every industry, from manufacturing to healthcare to technology. In manufacturing, workers are often specialized in specific tasks, such as assembling a single part of a car. In healthcare, doctors and nurses are specialized in different fields, such as pediatrics or cardiology. And in technology, programmers and developers are specialized in different coding languages and software systems.\n\nHowever, the division of labour is not without its drawbacks. One of the most significant criticisms of Smith's ideas is that they can lead to worker alienation and social inequality. When workers are only responsible for one small part of a larger process, they often lose sight of the final product or service they are contributing to. This can lead to a sense of detachment and disengagement from their work, which can ultimately lead to lower job satisfaction and motivation.\n\nFurthermore, the division of labour can lead to social inequality and exploitation, particularly in capitalist societies. Workers who are specialized in lower-skilled or manual labour tend to earn lower wages and have fewer opportunities for career advancement compared to those who are specialized in higher-skilled or managerial roles. This can create a class divide between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" widening the gap between the rich and the poor.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the division of labour remains a prevalent feature of modern economies. This is partly because it is seen as a necessary component of efficiency and productivity in the workplace. By dividing tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, businesses can streamline their operations and reduce costs. This, in turn, can lead to higher profits and a more sustainable business model.\n\nHowever, there are ways to mitigate the negative consequences of the division of labour. One way is through job enrichment, which means giving workers more responsibility and autonomy over their work. This can help to increase job satisfaction and motivation, as workers feel more invested in what they are doing. Another way is through job rotation, which means rotating workers among different tasks and responsibilities. This can help to reduce worker alienation and provide opportunities for skill development and career advancement.\n\nAnother potential solution is through the implementation of a basic income, which is a form of social welfare that provides a guaranteed income to every citizen regardless of their employment status. A basic income could help to alleviate the social inequality caused by the division of labour by providing a safety net for workers who are unable to find stable employment or who are stuck in low-skilled or low-paying jobs.\n\nIn conclusion, the division of labour has been a defining feature of modern economies for centuries. While it has its benefits, such as increased efficiency and productivity, it also has its drawbacks, such as worker alienation and social inequality. To mitigate these negative consequences, we can explore alternative approaches such as job enrichment, job rotation, and the implementation of a basic income. By doing so, we can work towards a more just and sustainable economy that benefits everyone.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"An urn contains 10 balls: 4 red and 6 blue. A second urn contains 16 red balls and an unknown number of blue balls. A single ball is drawn from each urn. The probability that both balls are the same color is 0.44. Calculate the number of blue balls in the second urn.\n\n– This problem is from beanactuary.org.\n\nBasic Probability Rules\n\nIf this is your first run at probability, kudos to you! Probabilities aren’t only a fundamental component of Statistics but also an inherent aspect of everyday life. This problem will utilize a few fundamental rules of probability, but first let’s define probability.\n\nDefinition\n\nProbability is a measure of the likelihood of a desired event(s) happening.\n\nWe obtain this value by dividing the number of possible ways of achieving the desired event by the total number of possible events.\n\nSince the total number of events is always equal to or larger than the desired event, probabilities are always a number between 0 and 1. If you obtain a number not within that range, check your arithmetic!\n\nExample\n\nSuppose we want to find the likelihood of drawing a blue ball from the first urn described above. Simply divide the number of blue balls in the first urn by the total number of balls in the urn.\n\nThe chance of drawing a blue ball from the first urn is 6\/10 or 0.60.\n\nCombining Probabilities\n\nThis is where it gets a little tricky. When we have multiple event probabilities, as in the problem above, we have to think about how to combine them. In general, there are two scenarios: the AND scenario, the OR scenario.\n\nthe AND scenario\n\nIn this scenario, we want more than one event to happen together. For example, drawing two red balls from the two urns described above is the same as saying,\n\n“I want to a red ball from the first urn AND a red ball from the second urn.”\n\nHere I have two distinct probabilities to calculate:\n\nDrawing a red ball from the first urn. Drawing a red ball from the second urn.\n\nOnce I calculate these probabilities, I multiply them together to obtain the combined “AND” probability.\n\nthe OR scenario\n\nIn the OR scenario, we recognize events or cases that could happen, but don’t all have to happen together. For example, in the above problem it tells us the probability of the both balls being the same color is 0.44. This can be thought of as:\n\n“Drawing two red balls OR two blue balls results in a probability of 0.44.”\n\nThe “OR” separates our calculation into two parts:\n\nDrawing two red balls (i.e drawing a red from the first urn AND a red from the second.) Drawing two blue balls (i.e. drawing a blue from the first AND a blue from the second.\n\nOnce I have calculated the two separate probabilities, I add them together to find the combined “OR” probability.\n\nSolution\n\n“The probability that both balls are the same color is 0.44,” is the same as saying, “Drawing two red balls OR two blue balls results in a probability of 0.44.” Replace drawing two red balls and drawing two blue balls with the AND statements we learned above:\n\n(Drawing a red ball from urn 1 AND a red from urn 2) OR (drawing a blue ball from urn 1 AND a blue from urn 2).\n\nDrawing a red ball from urn 1 AND a red ball from urn 2.\n\nTo solve this probability determine the individual probabilities of drawing a red ball from each respective urn.\n\nThe probability of drawing a red ball from urn 1 is 4\/10.\n\nCalculating the probability of red balls from urn 2 is a tad trickier. We know there are 16 red balls in the second urn, but we don’t know the total number of balls in the urn because we’re unsure of how many blue balls it holds.\n\nThat’s okay! The point of the problem is to figure out the number of blue balls in urn 2, so for the meantime we’ll let a variable represent the blue balls.\n\nNow write the expression for the probability of drawing a red ball from the second urn. (Note: the total number of balls in the urn is the RED + BLUE or in this case 16 + x.)\n\nSince this is an AND scenario, multiply the two fractions together.\n\nDrawing a blue ball from urn 1 AND a blue ball from urn 2.\n\nWe’ll leave that expression alone for a moment, and skip to the second AND scenario. Like above we calculate the two individual probabilities using x for the number of blue balls in urn 2.\n\nThis is another AND scenario, so multiply the two fractions together.\n\nImplementing the OR scenario\n\nRecall our original objective is writing an expression for this statement:\n\n(Drawing a red ball from urn 1 AND a red from urn 2) OR (drawing a blue ball from urn 1 AND a blue from urn 2) = 0.44.\n\nNow that we have the two AND scenarios, we can add them together, set equal to 0.44 and solve for x, the number of blue balls in urn 2.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nHave you ever found yourself so consumed by the internet that you forget who you really are? It’s easy to get lost in the world of online personas and social media, but it’s important to remember who we are in real life, too.\n\nIRL stands for “in real life,” which means the life we live outside of the internet. It’s important to have a balance between our online and offline lives. When we spend too much time on social media, we can become disconnected from our real emotions and relationships.\n\nOne way to maintain our IRL self is to take breaks from social media. It’s okay to unplug and disconnect from the online world for a while. Use that time to reconnect with family and friends, and to pursue hobbies and interests that you enjoy in real life.\n\nIt’s also important to be mindful of the information we share online. It’s easy to fall into the trap of sharing too much personal information or engaging in online behavior that we wouldn’t in real life. Remember that what you put online stays online forever, and could potentially harm your reputation or relationships with others.\n\nAnother way to stay connected to our IRL self is to maintain good communication skills. Social media and texting can make it easy to misinterpret messages and tone, so it’s important to practice good communication skills in person. That means listening actively, speaking clearly, and being respectful of others’ opinions and feelings.\n\nIt’s also important to maintain a positive attitude and outlook on life. It’s easy to get caught up in the negativity of online drama and toxic social media behavior, but it’s important to remember the good in our real lives. Surround yourself with positive people and focus on the things that make you happy in real life.\n\nFinally, it’s important to remember that we are more than just our online personas. We all have unique qualities and characteristics that define who we are in real life. Embrace your real self and celebrate your individuality. Don’t let the online world define you.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s important to remember that our online lives should never take priority over our real lives. We need to maintain a balance between our online and offline selves, and remember that we are more than just our online personas. Take breaks from social media, practice good communication skills in person, and maintain a positive attitude and outlook on life. When we are true to ourselves, both online and offline, we can lead happy, fulfilled lives.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Even after the development of more complex and powerful ML algorithms in recent times, linear regression is still hard to beat because of its versatility, robustness, and simplicity.\n\nLinear regression was originally developed in the field of statistics and is studied as a model for understanding the relationship between input and output numerical variables, but has been borrowed by ML. Now, it is classified both as a statistical algorithm and a machine learning algorithm.\n\nWhen there is a single input variable, the model is called simple linear regression and when there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.\n\nLinear Regression Graph ( Source: http:\/\/sphweb.bumc.bu.edu\/otlt\/MPH-Modules\/BS\/R\/R5_Correlation-Regression\/R5_Correlation-Regression_print.html)\n\nRepresentation\n\nLinear regression is represented by a linear equation that combines a set of input values (x) to the predicted output for that set of input values (y) where both x and y are numeric. (OBVIOUSLY!) This linear equation assigns a factor to each input value, known as coefficient (B). One coefficient is also added to give the line an additional degree of freedom (e.g. moving up and down on a two-dimensional plot) and is known as the bias coefficient.\n\nIn a simple regression model, the representation would be:\n\ny = B0 + B1*x\n\nIt represents a simple line. But in higher dimensions when we have more than one input values, this line is called a plane represented by:\n\ny=B0 + B1*x1+B2*x2+B3*x3\n\ny is also called dependent variable whereas x’s are known as independent variables.\n\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS)\n\nIn linear regression, you need to find the equation of the line that best fits your data. But now the question is “HOW?”\n\nThe best-fit line can be attained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference between the data points and the regression line. This is called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n\nThat means, we need to\n\nfind the values for B0 and B1 that minimizes the sum of squared errors where squared error for observation i can be calculated by using the given formula:\n\n(yi - (B0 + B1*xi))^2\n\nAnd the sum of squared error is just the sum of\n\n(yi - (B0 + B1*xi))^2 for all observations.\n\nThis approach treats the data as a matrix and uses linear algebra operations to estimate the optimal values for the coefficients. It means that all of the data must be available and you must have enough memory to fit the data and perform matrix operations.\n\nGradient Descent\n\nWhen there are one or more inputs, we can use a process of optimizing the values of the coefficients by iteratively minimizing the error on the training data. This operation is called Gradient Descent.\n\nIn this, we start with random values for each coefficient and then the sum of the squared errors is calculated for each pair of input and output values. A learning rate is used as a scale factor and the coefficients are updated in the direction towards minimizing the error. The process is repeated until a minimum sum squared error is achieved or no further improvement is possible. When using this method, a learning rate (alpha) parameter is selected that determines the size of the improvement step to take on each iteration.\n\nRegularization\n\nRegularization minimizes the sum of the squared error of the model on the training data and also reduces the complexity of the model (like the number or absolute size of the sum of all coefficients in the model).\n\nTwo popular examples of regularization procedures for linear regression are:\n\nLasso Regression: where Ordinary Least Squares is modified to also minimize the absolute sum of the coefficients (called L1 regularization).\n\nRidge Regression: where Ordinary Least Squares is modified to also minimize the squared absolute sum of the coefficients (called L2 regularization).\n\nThese methods are effective to use when there is collinearity in your input values and ordinary least squares would overfit the training data.\n\nOutliers and Influential Observations\n\nAfter a regression line has been computed for a group of data, a point which lies far from the line is known as an outlier. Such points may represent erroneous data, or may indicate a poorly fitting regression line.\n\nIf a point lies far from the other data in the horizontal direction, it is known as an influential observation. The reason for this distinction is that these points have may have a significant impact on the slope of the regression line.\n\nMetrics for model evaluation\n\nR-Squared value\n\nThis value ranges from 0 to 1. Value ‘1’ indicates predictor perfectly accounts for all the variation in y. Value ‘0’ indicates that predictor ‘x’ accounts for no variation in ‘y’.\n\nR^2 = 1 - (residual sum of squares \/ total sum of squares)\n\n1. Regression sum of squares (SSR)\n\nThis gives information about how far estimated regression line is from the horizontal ‘no relationship’ line (average of actual output).\n\n2. Sum of Squared error (SSE)\n\nThis tells us about how much the target value varies around the regression line .\n\n3. Total sum of squares (SSTO)\n\nThis tells how much the data point move around the mean.\n\nConclusion\n\nLinear Regression is the easy to understand and easiest to pick up algorithm. We have Ordinary Least Mean Square, Gradient descent and regularization techniques to find the line that best fits our data. We also discussed various metrics that are used in linear regression.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nGeorges Seurat's \"A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte\" is one of the most iconic paintings of the 19th century. Painted in 1884, the painting depicts a group of people relaxing on the banks of the River Seine, enjoying a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Seurat's unique style and technique, known as pointillism, make the painting both captivating and mysterious. However, understanding the painting requires a careful examination of its elements and symbols.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Seurat's painting is the use of pointillism, a technique that involves applying small, distinct dots of color to create an image. This technique is evident when one looks closely at the painting, and it is indeed what makes the painting so intriguing to many art enthusiasts. The use of pointillism creates an effect of light and color that gives the painting a sense of vibrancy and liveliness.\n\nThe painting is set on the banks of the River Seine, which is symbolized by the flowing water visible in the background. The river is an essential symbol of life, nature, and rejuvenation. The people in the painting are enjoying the natural beauty that surrounds them, and this is evident in the loose, relaxed postures of the figures. It is clear that they are at ease, enjoying the simple pleasures of life.\n\nThe figures in the painting are diverse, and they represent different social classes. The painting depicts the leisure class, which was an emerging social class in the late 19th century. The leisure class consisted of wealthy individuals who did not have to work for a living, and as such, they had more leisure time than others. The figures in the painting are dressed in their Sunday best, and they are enjoying a day out in the sun.\n\nThe clothing worn by the figures in the painting is also significant. The clothing is typical of the 19th century, and it is indicative of the social status of the figures. The women are dressed in long, flowing dresses, while the men are wearing jackets and trousers. The clothing also reflects the leisurely nature of the day. The light, airy fabrics are perfect for a warm, sunny day, and they add to the overall relaxed, carefree atmosphere of the painting.\n\nIn addition to the clothing, the accessories worn by the figures are also significant. The women are wearing hats, which were considered essential accessories for any fashionable woman of the time. The hats are not only practical for blocking the sun but also add a touch of elegance to the women's outfits. The parasols that some of the women are holding also serve a practical purpose of providing shade.\n\nThe use of color is also significant in the painting. The color palette is dominated by pastel colors, which add to the overall light and airy atmosphere of the painting. The colors also contribute to the sense of harmony and balance that is present in the painting. The use of contrasting colors is also evident in the painting, particularly with the use of complementary colors. For example, the use of blue and orange in the clothing adds visual interest and depth to the painting.\n\nIn conclusion, Seurat's \"A Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte\" is a masterpiece of 19th-century art. The painting captures the leisurely nature of the day, the beauty of nature, and the social status of the figures. Understanding the painting requires a careful examination of its elements and symbols. The use of pointillism, the clothing, accessories, color, and setting all contribute to the painting's overall atmosphere and meaning. Taking the time to carefully examine the painting reveals its true beauty and complexity.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Photo by Giammarco Boscaro on Unsplash\n\nIntroduction\n\nInternational law consists of a set of rules that govern the international relations between sovereign states. It can be classified into public international law and private international law. Public International Law deals with the laws between Nation-States and covers almost every aspect of the inter-state activity, from the laws of Seas, outer space, etc. However, Private International Law deals with relationships between individuals of two different states; for instance, divorce issues and problems pertaining to trade between individuals of two different states. In this non-technical piece of writing, it would be wise to narrow down the focus to just the history of International Law. So, the history or more specifically the development of International Law is divided into three main eras:\n\n1. Development during the Middle Ages and before\n\n2. Development during the 16th and 17th Centuries\n\n3. Development during the 18th Century and onwards\n\n1. Development During the Middle Ages and Before\n\nIn that era, almost all the civilized nations have made their contributions to the development of International Law.

{"prompt":"On Flexible Anti-Socialism\n\nBefore the October Revolution in the Russian Empire, many bourgeois scholars stated that socialism would be impossible to implement, going as far as exclaiming that it would be undesirable for the economic system to exist in any capacity regardless. This would lead to liberals embarking on the belief that capital and labour both need each other, when this is most definitely not the case.\n\nRight before one of the last May Day celebrations in the USSR. (Photo by Steve Harvey on Unsplash)\n\nHowever, following the success of the revolution and the subsequent establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the bourgeoisie throughout the world feared an educated and united proletarian mass pitted against them. As such, the introduction of various anti-communist propaganda took hold throughout countless societies around the world, but especially within the United States.\n\nMoving from its perceived ‘impossible’ nature, the calls changed towards pinning the ideas of ‘imperial conquest’ onto the USSR and its initiatives around the world. Of course, the rise of national liberation movements and the assistance granted by the USSR to these nations was largely what was seen as an act of ‘imperialism’, at least according to the Western world. As Richard Kosolapov puts it in Socialism: Question of Theory:\n\n“No longer do they say outright that it is impossible and undesirable to build socialism. Instead, they call for its ‘democratization’, ‘liberalization’, ‘humanization’, meaning a free hand for forces hostile to socialism, and turning the Communist Party, the only party though which true people’s power can be exercised consistently, into just one of many rival organizations, societies, unions, and so on.”\n\nWhat Kosolapov is stating in the excerpt above is that the bourgeoisie consistently figures out ways to combat socialism, especially when the development of a class conscious proletarian mass is occurring. As mentioned earlier, the success of the October Revolution signaled a worry within the industrialists and the Western bourgeoisie. The mass industrialization of the USSR and its transition from a back-watered feudal state into the second largest economy in the world signaled a threat to newly established American hegemony.\n\nIn the 1990s, the bourgeoisie took a more passive role in undermining the development of the socialist-oriented masses, largely placing emphasis on how the United States and free-market capitalism “won” the Cold War and, more specifically, how liberalism is the superior path moving forward. Political scientist Francis Fukayama infamously came to this deeply problematic and incorrect conclusion in his 1992 book, The End of History and the Last Man.\n\nIn the present day, the rise of China has signaled discussion of the “new” or “Second” Cold War occurring between West and East. This was most recently witnessed with the Trump administration’s vicious hostility exhibited towards China and their immense levels of growth. U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo has stated the following message numerous times:\n\nOf course, this is done to portray the CCP as something ‘bad’ in the eyes of the United States government, as well as prey on the already existing hatred for all things deemed “Marxist” or “Leninist”. It is devoid of any analysis, understanding, or legitimate thought process, especially when taking into account the lack of engagement with China and their political and economic structure.\n\nNot to mention, this already preys on all activists, as it only takes them to be labeled “Marxist-Leninist” to be considered enemies in the eyes of the bourgeois state. As previously mentioned in an article of mine, your own political differences with regards to Marxism-Leninism matter very little when it comes down to the projection of hostility towards the proletariat by the bourgeoisie.\n\nFurthermore, the capitalist class will utilize all available paths to halt the progression of the inevitable class war between themselves and the masses, the working class. This is done to a more ‘radical’ degree when there is already a threat to the bourgeois superstructure around the world, whether that be a workers’ revolution in one of the great powers, the rapid development of the USSR, the current growth of China, and so on. The bourgeoisie care little about the fine mechanics of socialist construction, whether or not a country is deemed socialist by the masses, and other similar ideas. If an alternative to free-market capitalism and multi-party elections exists somewhere throughout the world, then it will be viewed as a threat to the Western status-quo that has been in place for over 50 years now.\n\n“Is there any way other than revolution with proletarian hegemony to achieve true, not formal, democracy? History has given the answer: no, there is not.”\n\nThis quote by Kosolapov illustrates the importance that the imperialists place on the construction of a socialist movement, let alone a socialist society.\n\nThey understand that capital and their role in society drives the bourgeois political system and structure. They understand that a suppressed proletariat is one that can easily be warped and manipulated. They understand that the demonization of what is deemed to be socialist will assist their continued exploitation of the international working class.\n\nIn essence, the bourgeoisie need not attack socialism based on its merits, but rather simply conjure up a frightening picture, a mere illustration of what socialism is. This is solely to further eliminate and stifle the growth of class consciousness, as well as strike angst in the minds of the proletariat. It is with this understanding of the bourgeois class and their commitment to maintaining present class relations and control over the means of production that the sheer power they possess can be visualized.\n\nSocialism is adaptable, but the bourgeoisie are able to consistently adapt at a quicker and more advanced rate. Understandably, this is due to their control over the state apparatus, influence over both the base and the superstructure, and the sheer amount of capital that is freely available to them. The most intensified form of class struggle will persist within bourgeois society, and largely because of the flexibility of the capitalists to alter their anti-socialist positions.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nWorld War II was a time of immense technological advances in the field of aviation. The race to develop better and faster aircraft was a top priority for both Allied and Axis powers. The Allies, particularly the United States and Great Britain, were particularly interested in obtaining information about enemy technology. This led to the creation of specialized units tasked with gathering and analyzing intelligence on German jet aircraft. This hunt for enemy technology played a crucial role in the development of early jets.\n\nEarly in World War II, the Allies were dominated by Axis air superiority. This was due in part to the differences between the technologies of the two sides. Axis planes were faster, more maneuverable, and more heavily armed than their Allied counterparts. It was clear that the Allies needed to improve their aircraft to turn the tide of the war. The development of jet engines was seen as a potential solution to this problem.\n\nThe Germans were the first to successfully develop and utilize jet aircraft during the war. In 1939, a German engineer named Hans von Ohain successfully tested the first jet engine. The engine was used in the Heinkel He 178, the world's first jet-powered aircraft. Later in the war, the Germans would use jet aircraft in combat, including the famous Messerschmitt Me 262, which was used to devastating effect against Allied bombers.\n\nThe Allied response to these technological advances was the formation of specialized units tasked with gathering intelligence on enemy technology. One such unit was the British Aviation Intelligence Unit (AIU). The AIU was established in 1939 and was tasked with gathering intelligence on German aircraft. The unit was initially focused on traditional intelligence gathering methods, such as aerial reconnaissance and prisoner interrogation. However, as the war progressed, the AIU began to focus more on the analysis of captured enemy aircraft and technical manuals.\n\nThe AIU's work was instrumental in the development of Allied jet aircraft. In 1944, the British obtained a complete example of the Messerschmitt Me 262. The aircraft was quickly disassembled and examined in detail. The AIU's analysis of the aircraft's design and construction helped British engineers develop their own jet-powered aircraft, including the Gloster Meteor.\n\nThe United States also established specialized units to gather intelligence on enemy technology. The most famous of these units was the Air Technical Intelligence Command (ATIC). The ATIC was established in 1944 and was responsible for gathering intelligence on German aircraft and other technological developments. The ATIC's work was crucial in the development of several important American aircraft, including the P-80 Shooting Star.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of the hunt for enemy technology was the use of deception and subterfuge. Both the Allies and the Axis powers engaged in efforts to mislead the enemy about their technological capabilities. One famous example of this was the German's use of decoy aircraft to mislead Allied intelligence. The Germans built full-scale decoys of their jet aircraft, which they placed in locations where they would be easily seen by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. The decoys were designed to make it appear as though the Germans had large numbers of jet aircraft, when in reality, they only had a few.\n\nThe Allies also engaged in deception efforts. One such effort was the creation of the \"Special Technical Air Reconnaissance\" (STAR) program. The STAR program was designed to deceive the Germans into thinking that the Allies had developed advanced reconnaissance aircraft. The program involved flying modified B-17 bombers over enemy territory, equipped with specialized cameras and other equipment. The Germans were led to believe that the aircraft were capable of taking detailed photographs of enemy installations, when in reality, the cameras were not advanced enough to capture such images.\n\nIn conclusion, the hunt for enemy technology played a crucial role in the development of early jets. The Allies recognized the importance of technological advances in aviation and made it a top priority to obtain information about enemy aircraft. Specialized units were established to gather intelligence on enemy technology, and the analysis of captured enemy aircraft and technical manuals helped Allied engineers develop their own jet-powered aircraft. The use of deception and subterfuge also played a role in the hunt for enemy technology. While the Allies were ultimately successful in obtaining information about enemy technology, it is important to remember the sacrifices made by those who worked to gather this information. The hunt for enemy technology was a dangerous and often deadly task, but it was crucial in the fight against Axis air superiority.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nSleepwalking has always been a misunderstood phenomenon that has caused many controversies and debates over time. It is a disorder where a person walks or performs other activities while in a deep sleep state, and they can have no recollection of what they have done during their sleepwalking episode. However, there have been rare cases where sleepwalking has led to violent behavior and even murder. In this essay, we will discuss five sleepwalking killers from criminal history.\n\nThe first sleepwalking killer on our list is Kenneth Parks, a 23-year-old Canadian man who killed his mother-in-law in 1987. Parks had no history of mental illness or criminal tendencies, but he had started experiencing sleepwalking episodes after being stressed at work. One night, he drove 23 kilometers to his in-laws’ home, broke in through the front door, and attacked his mother-in-law with a tire iron. Later, he drove himself to the police station and turned himself in, claiming he had no memory of the incident. A jury acquitted him of murder because they believed that his behavior was a result of an involuntary act of sleepwalking.\n\nThe second sleepwalking killer on our list is Scott Falater. In 1997, Falater, a 41-year-old Arizona man, stabbed his wife 44 times and let her drown in their backyard pool. After the murder, he went back to bed and fell asleep. The next morning, Falater was found washing his clothes and irrigating his lawn. During the trial, it was revealed that Falater had a history of sleepwalking, and witnesses testified that they had seen him sleepwalking on several occasions. However, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nThe third sleepwalking killer on our list is Brian Thomas, an Australian man who killed his neighbor in 2004. Thomas had a history of sleepwalking, and his wife had warned their neighbor about it. One night, Thomas broke into his neighbor’s house, and although the neighbor tried to defend himself, Thomas killed him. When Thomas woke up the next morning, he had no recollection of what had happened, and he called the police to report a break-in at his neighbor’s house. Thomas was charged with murder, but he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter and was sentenced to eight years in prison.\n\nThe fourth sleepwalking killer on our list is Jules Lowe, a British woman who killed her father in 2007. Lowe had a history of sleepwalking, and her father had installed a burglar alarm to alert him if she left her bedroom. However, one night, Lowe managed to disable the alarm and killed her father with a kitchen knife. She then went back to bed, and when her mother found her the next morning, she had no memory of the incident. During the trial, Lowe was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity and was sent to a secure psychiatric unit for an indefinite period.\n\nThe fifth and final sleepwalking killer on our list is Albert Tirrell, a 19th-century American man who killed his mistress in 1845. Tirrell was a wealthy businessman who was having an affair with a prostitute named Maria Bickford. One night, Tirrell killed Bickford with a knife and claimed that he had done it while sleepwalking. He also claimed that he had no memory of the incident, and his defense team argued that he was not responsible for his actions while sleepwalking. Tirrell was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, but his case was appealed, and he was granted a retrial. However, before the retrial could take place, Tirrell escaped from prison and was never seen again.\n\nIn conclusion, sleepwalking has been a topic of interest for many years, and it is fascinating to learn about the rare cases where it has led to violent behavior and murder. The cases of Kenneth Parks, Scott Falater, Brian Thomas, Jules Lowe, and Albert Tirrell are examples of how sleepwalking can have severe implications and can lead to life-changing consequences. Although these cases are rare, they serve as a reminder that sleepwalking is a disorder that should be taken seriously and that people who suffer from it should seek professional help. It is essential to create awareness about sleepwalking and educate people about the risks associated with it to avoid such tragic and violent outcomes in the future.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"People ask me “when have things in the US ever looked this bad?” I reply, “1968, to name just the most recent time,” but I do understand their consternation. Things do look bad in the US and we need to ask why. Some of you will say, “Trump is why things are so bad,” but that’s too easy. America’s problems run far deeper than that bumbling buffoon. Trump is a symptom. Hear me out.\n\nIs The US Falling Apart?\n\nFirst off, yeah, it is sad to see what’s going on the US. The pandemic has vividly exposed the US’s structural flaws and social fault lines. Income inequality, white supremacist violence, climate crisis, runaway corporatism, and the siloization of Americans such that civil conversation is all but dead… it’s an unsettled landscape and few if any American leaders are remotely able to deal with the many problems.\n\nAnd, yeah, about poor leaders: yes, especially Trump. Trump is a terrible president and worse, a terrible human being. I need not run off a litany of his of his many faults. All partisanship aside, the political sniping that dominates America these days is not only nonproductive, it is actively harmful. No one benefits from childish memes about Trump and his allies or Biden and his allies. Such attacks are just about all that we hear anymore, including from politicians. America isn’t solving its problems because the leaders are more interested in blaming their enemies than in solving problems.\n\nIs Trump the Problem?\n\nLet’s take a quick quiz.\n\nIs Trump a liar? Is Trump a greedy narcissistic businessman? Does Trump live in a privileged bubble detached from reality?\n\nIf you answered “yes” to these three questions, you are correct.\n\nOkay, now let’s take a second quiz.\n\nIs Trump the first politician to lie? Is Trump the first greedy narcissistic businessman? Is Trump the first to live in a privileged bubble detached from reality?\n\nIf you answered “no” to these three questions, you are correct.\n\nThe purpose of this exercise is to steer the conversation away from Trump to the much more useful topic of the social system that created Trump and enabled him to become president. Trump is a symptom of a much larger set of problems.\n\nYou may respond, “but Trump is exceptional!” Yes, but only in being exceptionally open and blatant about what he is. Consider the possibility that Trump is no more and no less than a somewhat more dishonest, narcissistic, spoiled manchild who has a whole lot less impulse control.\n\nWhat Is the Problem?\n\nHere’s something more important to consider. How is it that this dishonest, narcissistic, spoiled manchild was able to become President? That Trump is President of the United States and could very well win re-election is less a statement about Trump than it is about the United States. How it happened and what it means needs to be considered.\n\nTrump became President within a system. He’s responsible for his actions, but it is a system that allowed, if not enabled, him to inflict his actions on the world. If Trump is wrong then something is also wrong with the American system that is enabling his wrongdoing.\n\nBecause here’s the thing: all of the problems that are today plaguing the United States were there before Trump, and they’ve been there a long time. Trump didn’t create any of them; he simply is more shameless about exacerbating and exploiting them.\n\nWhat’s wrong with the Trump presidency; are they at all new?\n\n· Racism? United States has had that since its inception (the Constitution enshrined blacks as three-fifths of a person, remember?)\n\n· Sexism? Ditto.\n\n· Hostility toward immigrants? The paradox is the United States is a nation of immigrants but each group of immigrants were hostile toward the next ones.\n\n· Neglect for the environment? Nixon created the EPA 50 years ago for a reason.\n\n· Corruption? Power corrupts. It corrupted presidents. It corrupted administrations, nearly every single one in US history.\n\n· Alienating foreign nations? Kissinger captured it when he said “America has no permanent friends or enemies, only interests.”\n\n· Denial of science? A long history of that from US presidents.\n\n· Hostility toward the working poor? You can’t possibly believe that’s new.\n\n· Twitter misbehavior? Okay, I’ll give you that one, but imagine if Nixon or Reagan had a Twitter account.\n\nThe point is that if you are honest and not blinded by rank partisanship, you have to admit that the evils of Donald Trump are manifestations of long-entrenched evils. Trump is simply a symptom. I don’t for a second suggest that we not oppose Trump’s excesses, but unless you are also willing to oppose the injustices that are entrenched in the United States political and legal systems that enable Trump, you are, in the end, also enabling Trump and future Trumps, who just might be worse.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Two Wars and a Song\n\nA Brief History of Guilhem de Tudela’s Crusade Song\n\nwritten by Andrew Thornebrooke\n\nGuilhem de Tudela’s Canso de la Crozada, more commonly referred to by its French title, Chanson de la Croisade Albigeoise, is an epic poem written in Old Occitan which follows the events of the Albigensian Crusades. Written in two parts, first by Tudela during the war, and later by an anonymous continuator in the thirteenth century, the poem offers a rich narrative for the historical events of the conflict and how it was perceived.\n\nTudela’s poem is written in verse, reflecting the form and content of many northern French works of the chanson de geste genre, and is 9,572 lines in length. Structurally, the first section of the canso is based on the Chanson de Antioch, which Guilhem cites in the second laisse, writing “this song is modelled on that of Antioch and has the same verse structure and, for those who can use it, melody.” The narrative frame of the canso is interestingly divided in scope and intent, with Tudela’s contribution, forming the first third of the work, presenting a sweeping and heroic narrative of the French army up until Tudela’s death in 1214, while the anonymously-written second portion of the text presents an uncommon and quite sombre telling of the remainder of the conflicts up through 1219.\n\nThe ending point of the poem in 1219, shortly after the siege of Toulouse and the death of Simon de Montfort, offers an interesting question as to the purpose of the anonymous author’s contribution. Considering that the Occitan campaign ended a decade later, in 1229, and that the second author likely finished the work in the latter half of the thirteenth century, the ending of the story may suggest that the later campaigns in the 1220’s were seen as a separate conflict, or that, perhaps, the narrative was employed in a semi-biographical nature around the lords of Toulouse and Montfort and Pope Innocent III, who had all died by 1219.\n\nThere is a single surviving manuscript of Tudela’s work in its entirety, preserved at the Biblitheque nationale de France. Most likely written in Toulouse around 1275, it has served as the basis of every critical edition of the work, and to date, there has been no attempt to compile an edition which incorporates other manuscript fragments. Additionally, such a path of transmission makes it quite difficult to determine the popularity of the text or its use with contemporaries, despite its being one of only three narrative accounts of the Albigensian Crusades.\n\nThe first published edition of the work was Claude Fauriel’s 1837 French translation, and the first critical edition, published in two volumes in 1875 and 1879 by Paul Meyer, also contained a French translation. Further editions consist of a three-volume version by Eugene Martin-Chabot, published in 1973; a bilingual (French and Occitan) edition with a full facsimile of the original manuscript, compiled by Henri Gougaud and published in 1984; and, most recently, an English Translation by Janet Shirley in 1996.\n\nTudela’s epic offers invaluable insight into one of the most significant wars of French history\n\nCanso de la Crozada is an invaluably significant work for the study of the later crusades, and particularly of the European campaigns. Its value stems from the fact that there are so few other sources documenting the Albigensian Crusades, that it offers accounts of narrators from both sides of the conflict, and offers both a panegyric and narrative basis for one of the first instance of military contact in a crusading context between Latin Christians. Additionally, the text can be mined for small gems which relate to the study of material history, as well as the field of military history, as it offers detailed account of the movement of troops, their routes for supplies, and the manner in which spoils of war were divided up and for what purposes, such as in its depiction of the siege of Carcassonne.\n\nPedagogically, Canso de la Crozada could most effectively be used to teach the later crusades within the context of intra-European Christian violence and the institutional development of instrument for holy war developed by the pontificate of Innocent III, which are frequently referred to in the work. Tudela’s account also serves as a wonderful tool for prosopographic inquiry, as it finely details the movements, locations, relationships, and agreements of the major players of the Occitan campaigns, including the lords of Aragon, France, and Occitania. Finally, it may be particularly well received when divided into two by author, and studied in comparison for the purposes of navigating the nuances of how drastically different perceptions of a crusade could be between persons within a region.\n\nOverall, Guilhem de Tudela’s poem is a rich and powerful narrative source, which offers a keen insight into the lived experiences of crusade in the thirteenth century, as well as the ideology of crusading. The limited manuscript tradition, while hampering to the study of the poem’s transmission, is nonetheless useful for winnowing out the potential of multiple versions being confused. Both the form and content of the work, and its editions, make the canso an invaluable resource to the teaching of the later crusades.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"The Lady Who Stopped the Killing of Twins\n\nMary Slessor (Image source: workoutyourfaith.com)\n\nMost people don’t believe that in the past centuries, twins were killed in a certain part of Africa. As far back as the 19th century, the barbaric and archaic custom of killing twins once existed amongst the Ibibio people of Nigeria.\n\nAccording to this custom, it was considered taboo to have twins. Twins were seen as powerful beings, not humans. They were perceived as bad luck and mini-gods and it was believed that evil had befallen any community where they were born.\n\nWhile the usual tradition of killing twins persisted, their parents and families were also treated as outcasts. Sometimes it got so bad that some mothers of the “forbidden twins\" were banished from the land without any means of support.\n\nThe ancient custom would usually require a witch doctor to prepare a poisonous liquid which would be given to the twins to kill them. In villages where this happened, the inhabitants were fully aware of the prevalence of such a custom because many generations were affected and still have stories to tell about it.\n\nIn 1876, Mary Slessor, a Scottish missionary was assigned to Efik Land in Calabar, Nigeria. She was well known for her genuine interest in the rights and well-being of women and children. With time, Mary took it upon herself to gradually change the wrongly perceived notion amongst the people that twins were evil. She consistently worked towards changing such cultural belief.\n\nWhile Mary enlightened the people, she also preached the gospel of Christ. She shared a deeper bond with the people and learned their local dialect, the Efik language. She also ate their locally made food. At some point, Mary started dressing like the other local women residing in the area.\n\nWithout giving up her faith, she practically adopted some of the people’s ways of living. However, speaking against twin killing was not a day’s work as it took constant sensitization and education of those who practiced this preposterous custom.\n\nMary was so passionate about reversing the obsolete custom that she started adopting any abandoned baby that was left to die and took care of them at the Mission House.\n\nWithin a short time, she adopted eight children who became like a family to her as she continued her missionary work in more remote areas. She later succeeded in having a few converts who eventually became Christians.\n\nMary’s impact was immeasurable and in 1892, she was appointed the vice-consul of the Okoyong territory by the British Consul-general, Major Claude MacDonald.\n\nMary Slessor and some adopted twins who later became family (Source:Maryslessor.org )\n\nAfter dedicating her life to the service of God and humanity, Mary passed away in 1915 at the age of 66.\n\nMany years after her death, Mary’s legacy lives on as her indelible marks and value for human life are deeply entrenched in the sands of time.\n\nAs a form of remembrance and acknowledgment of her great works, the Mary Slessor Foundation was set up in 2002 as a skill acquisition center to train young people. Mary was also the first woman to appear on a Scottish banknote in 1997.\n\nWhat changed after Mary Slessor’s death?\n\nWith the advent of Christianity and civilization, the “twin-killing custom\" gradually reduced. For years, nothing was heard about it.\n\nThrough Christianity, the people were taught that it was a sin to kill because of the demands of an indigenous belief.\n\nHowever, in a 2018 article, the Reuters Foundation reported that up until 1996, this act of infanticide was still being secretly practiced.\n\nThe report noted that, in fact, some mothers still had to give up their twin babies to children foundations in order to avoid the untimely maiming of their offspring.\n\nAlthough the communities still blatantly deny that it exists, there are silent whispers that it still operates.\n\nOne of the locals who refused to reveal his identity had said:\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Nellie Jackson in her Rankin Street “boarding house,” 1980s.\n\nEveryone loves a story about a hooker with a heart of gold. But have you heard the one about the madam into mutual aid and honey trapping white supremacists? As the kids say: It slaps.\n\nNellie Jackson was born the grandchild of freed slaves around 1902 in Mississippi, a draw which usually meant little education, even less money, and a lotta bullshit. She grew up in Possom Corner, which was less of a town than a small settlement outside nearby oil fields. By her 20s she’d married and fled to the nearest river city: Natchez, a place known primarily for its stately antebellum mansions and poor wage slaves.\n\nThe area had no middle class.\n\nAfter a divorce and a few perilous years working “Under the Hill,” the rough section of Natchez known for generalized depravity, Nellie purchased a modest house on Rankin Street. She transformed the unassuming residential property it into a “boarding house”…one which just happened to house nothing but beautiful women.\n\nOver the next two decades, Nellie’s slowly became one of the most popular brothels in the Deep South. Men literally lined the block for a chance to be granted access. Working girls from New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and New Orleans would take the train to Natchez just to work for Miss Nellie. Locals could pop their head into the large kitchen pretty much any day and find its madam standing over the stove herself, stirring some of the most delicious soul food within 50 miles in any direction. The establishment only served white men — something initially upsetting to members of Nellie’s community — but this was due to safety, not bigotry.\n\nNatchez was a recruitment hot spot for the KKK and its unfortunate offshoot, The White Knights. A mixed-race brothel run by a black woman would have been burned to the ground in a place like Mississippi. By catering to white men, Nellie knew she could protect her investment and girls. And, as it turned out, the practice eventually delivered priceless leverage into her modestly manicured hands.\n\nSee, white supremacists LOVE fooling around with women of color. They wring hands about the horrors of “race mixing” during their costume parties and BBQs, and decry sex work as a tool of Satan. But when it’s time to get drunk and blow off…uh…”steam,” there’s ample documentation that they crave nothing more than forbidden fruit like Nellie’s deliciously diverse women. (Ask any sex worker of color about this phenomenon today and she’ll tell you nothing has changed.)\n\nWhen the Civil Rights movement finally heated up, Nellie’s was being frequented by more Klansmen, Knights, and White Citizen’s Council members than ever looking to fulfill their fetishes.\n\nFun Fact: Intoxicated men with blood pooled in their southern hemisphere are TERRIBLE at keeping secrets, especially when they’re trying to impress pretty women.\n\nWhich is why Nellie Jackson, middle-aged madam of color, was able to become a very valuable informant for the FBI. The bureau would fly a few stiffs in suits to Natchez a few times a year, who would head to Miss Nellie’s private boudoir at 3am on an off night. They’d lay down upon her red, satin bedspread…then remain full clothed and take notes as Nellie spilled every detail\/plan the Klansmen and Knights let slip while under her roof. She never accepted a dime from the government in return. Business was doing so well she genuinely didn’t need it.\n\nAnd that wasn’t all Nellie was up to in her free time. When black civil rights protestors were arrested and held in Natchez one October, a single persuasive phone call from Madam Jackson to the Sheriff got 200+ released within a day. Miss Nellie bailed out anti-racists in cash herself. Her money also quietly funded food banks for battered women and orphans; bought cars for single moms and working men; supported the local church; and paid for countless bags of groceries or overdue utility bills all over town. Police officers, aldermen, and mayors often found themselves receiving bottles of brandy, home cooked meals, and cases of beer from Miss Nellie and her girls.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, in roughly 60 YEARS of operation, Nellie Jackson’s brothel never endured a single effort from the city or community to close down, despite literally everyone in town knowing what her “boarding house” really was.\n\nThe unbelievable story of Nellie Jackson is even more fascinating — and ultimately shocking — than what was shared here. But we think it’s best told with sound effects, underscoring, and the help of a historian who specializes in the history of American sex work. You can sign up for our “Secret Story Time” over on Patreon to hear her whole amazing tale later this month at: www.patreon.com\/hottesthellpresents.\n\nThis piece published in collaboration with Hottest Hell Tours, New Orleans’ best dark history experience.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}

{"prompt":"\n\nAs I stood at the base of the Eildon Hills, I felt a sense of excitement and trepidation. I had heard many stories about the beauty of these hills and the stunning vistas that awaited those who made it to the top. At the same time, I knew that the climb would be strenuous and challenging, and my muscles were already starting to ache just thinking about it.\n\nBut I was determined to make it to the top, and so I set off at a steady pace, taking in the sights and sounds of the hills around me. I could hear the gentle rustle of the grass and the distant bleating of sheep. The sun was shining brightly overhead, casting a warm glow over everything in sight.\n\nAs I climbed higher and higher, the landscape around me began to change. The grass became thicker, and the trees grew taller and more dense. I could see for miles in every direction, and the view was breathtaking.\n\nBut despite the beauty of my surroundings, my aches and pains were becoming more and more pronounced. My legs felt heavy and stiff, and my breath was coming in short, labored gasps. I knew that I still had a long way to go, and I wondered if I would be able to make it to the top at all.\n\nAs I walked, I became increasingly aware of the physical effort that was required of me to keep going. Every step felt like a struggle, and my muscles screamed in protest with every movement. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I wondered if I was pushing myself too hard.\n\nFor a moment, I considered stopping and turning back. But then I remembered why I had come in the first place. I wanted to experience the beauty of the Eildon Hills, and I knew that if I gave up now, I would never know what lay ahead.\n\nSo I kept going, one step at a time, watching as the landscape continued to change around me. The grass gave way to rocky outcrops and craggy cliffs, and the trees disappeared altogether. Now the wind was whipping through my hair, and the sun was beating down on my back. But still, I pressed on.\n\nFinally, after what felt like hours of climbing, I made it to the top. I collapsed onto the ground, gasping for breath and feeling a sense of relief wash over me. But as I looked out over the vista before me, I knew that the effort had been worth it.\n\nThe view was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Rolling hills stretched out in every direction, their green slopes dotted with sheep and cattle. The sky was a brilliant blue, and the sun was casting long shadows over the landscape.\n\nAs I sat there, catching my breath and taking in the view, I realized something important. The aches and pains that had plagued me on the way up the hill had been a necessary part of the experience. Without them, I would not have been able to appreciate the beauty of the hills as fully as I did.\n\nThis realization stayed with me as I made my way back down the hill. Although my muscles were still sore and my body was tired, I felt a sense of contentment and satisfaction that I had not felt before. I had pushed myself to my limits and come out the other side, stronger and more appreciative of the world around me.\n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, I found myself thinking back on my experience on the Eildon Hills often. It had been a turning point for me, a moment when I had pushed myself beyond what I thought was possible and discovered something new about myself in the process.\n\nAnd while I knew that I would not be climbing the Eildon Hills again anytime soon, I also knew that the physical and emotional strength that I had gained on that journey would stay with me for a long time to come. \n\nIn conclusion, climbing the Eildon Hills was an experience I will never forget. It taught me to push myself beyond my limits and appreciate the beauty of the world around me. It reminded me that sometimes, a little pain and discomfort is necessary to truly appreciate the good things in life. And most importantly, it showed me that I am capable of achieving amazing things if I only set my mind to it.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Galileo Galilei: Source-Wikipedia\n\nA weak man stood kneeling in front of an inquiry panel in the Vatican. It was the peak of inquisition, and heresy spared no one — the 50-year-old man was charged with discriminating Christian beliefs.\n\nThough being a close friend of the Pope, he had to stand trial. The great mind confessed to his guilt and asked for pardon. The man was Galileo Galilei. He was asking forgiveness for saying that the sun is the center of the solar system and not Earth.\n\nEarly life:\n\nGalileo Galilei was one of the greatest renaissance scientists born in Italy. Galileo got inspired by various other scientists of his time and read through their works.\n\nGalileo heard the usage of the lens to see small objects termed as a microscope. He immediately jumped into the idea of modifying it and using it to see objects in the far distance.\n\nHis concept of telescope revolutionized astronomy. He observed that the moon is not entirely flawless, and it has craters. He discovered Jupiter’s moons too.\n\nGalileo telescopes brought him business opportunities from Venice. Venice was known for its maritime activities and needed telescopes for navigation. Galileo provided state of the art telescopes to Venetians. Galileo also equipped Venice’s defenses with lenses to concentrate sunlight on enemy ships and make them catch fire.\n\nInquisition:\n\nThe Inquisition was in full force during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance . Any opinion which contradicts general Christian beliefs was considered heresy.\n\nAnyone charged with heresy stands trial and trials usually end badly for the accused. New scientific ideas need to confirm with Christian theology. However, rebel scientists have already started challenge the Church.\n\nNicolaus Copernicus of Poland came up with the theory that, as per his calculations and observations, the sun is the center of the solar system. According to the Christian thinking of the Middle Ages, the Earth is the center of the solar system.\n\nAll the planets and even the sun revolve around the Earth. Many scientists looking into the sky have already spotted the anomaly, but no-one was ready to question the Church.\n\nGalileo took up the quest to prove his theory of a sun-centered solar system by calculating the tidal waves of Venice. If Earth is the Center of the solar system, then Venice will have only one high tide in a day. On the contrary, Venice had two high tides in a day, thus proving Earth is not the Center of the solar system.\n\n\n\nBased on Copernicus’s conclusion and his observations Galileo, too, came to the point that Earth is not the center of the solar system. Copernicus was considered a heretic. Church authorities across Europe burnt Copernicus’s books.\n\nGalileo was enthralled with the new idea and wanted to publish a book on it. Galileo also wanted to avoid the wrath of the church.\n\nThe Dialogue:\n\nThe Dialogue: Source:Wikipedia\n\nGalileo went to his friend the Pope with an idea. Galileo proposed writing a comedy play in which scientific ideas are portrayed as fiction.\n\nThe Pope agreed to the proposal. Galileo came up with the idea of composing the book based on dialogues between two friends and a moderator.\n\nGalileo took the liberty of portraying one of the friends as the pope and also to represent the pope’s idea. The dialogue revolves around the discussion on the scientific facts proving that the sun is the center of the solar system and not the Earth. The Inquisition censor looked into the book, and the title got reduced to just “The Dialogue.”\n\n\n\nOnce the book was published, it caused problems in the Christian world, even for the Pope. Many critics raised concerns that the Pope’s portrayal is terrible in the book.\n\nThe book was banned, and all copies were confiscated. The book got added to the Vatican Blacklist.\n\nGalileo was called to the Vatican to testify in front of the Inquisition. Galileo argued his point, but it fell on deaf ears as the inquisition had decided the verdict.\n\nGalileo faced physiological torture of not having any communication with the outside world was. Galileo, at last, broke down and accepted to be guilty. Galileo said\n\nAnd yet it moves\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Inquisition gave a verdict of keeping Galileo under house arrest under a cardinal. Later he was released to house arrest in his villa in Florence.\n\nDuring this time, he wrote the book two sciences, which was praised by Newton. He lived the rest of his life in loneliness. One of the greatest minds of humanity spends his last years in vain.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nWhy America Banned Pre-Sliced Bread\n\nDid you know that pre-sliced bread was once banned in America? Yes, you read it right! In the early 1940s, the government of the United States of America mandated a temporary ban on pre-sliced bread. The decision was made to reduce waste and conserve resources during World War II.\n\nDuring the war, the government had to ration many items that were considered essential, including wheat and bread. The Office of Price Administration, which was responsible for controlling prices and rationing during the war, observed that pre-sliced bread was leading to a lot of wastage. The loaves were being sliced too thin, which meant that people were wasting bread by throwing away the small, uneven slices.\n\nAdditionally, the machines used to slice bread required a lot of metal parts, which were in high demand for the war effort. Therefore, by banning pre-sliced bread, the government hoped to reduce waste and conserve resources by encouraging people to buy whole loaves of bread and slice them at home.\n\nThe ban was met with mixed reactions, with some people supporting it and others opposing it. People who were used to buying pre-sliced bread found it inconvenient to switch to whole loaves, while others found it to be a patriotic duty to help conserve resources during the war.\n\nHowever, the ban was relatively short-lived. It was only in effect for a few months before it was lifted in March 1943. The government realized that the ban had not led to significant savings, and people found it too inconvenient to continue cutting bread at home.\n\nDespite the short-lived ban, it had a significant impact on the bread industry. The ban led bakers to produce larger loaves of bread with the intention of reducing wastage. The larger loaves became known as \"victory loaves,\" and they were soon a popular symbol of patriotism during the war.\n\nThe lifting of the ban also led to the development of new bread-slicing machines that were more efficient and produced uniform slices. These new machines were a significant improvement over the old ones, and they soon became popular among bakers across the country.\n\nLooking back, it may seem strange that a ban on pre-sliced bread was ever necessary. But during the war, every little thing mattered, and the government had to use every means possible to conserve resources and reduce waste. The ban may have only been temporary, but it played an essential role in winning the war.\n\nIn conclusion, the ban on pre-sliced bread was a temporary but significant measure taken by the American government during World War II. The goal was to reduce waste and conserve resources during a time of great need. While the ban may have caused inconvenience, it was an effective way to encourage people to think about the impact of their actions on the war effort. Today, pre-sliced bread is a common sight in bakeries and supermarkets across the country, but we should never forget the sacrifices and efforts made by previous generations to ensure our freedom and prosperity.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"America’s First Suicide Hotline Was a Single Phone in San Francisco\n\nModern-day crisis hotlines like this are modeled after Bernard Mayes’ original program from the 1960s. Photo: Steven Clevenger\/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nWhen someone calls the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, they’re routed to one of over 180 crisis centers across the country, where health professionals and volunteers are standing by, ready to help them through a crisis.\n\nBut the first U.S. suicide hotline was a far more modest setup: a single red telephone in San Francisco’s Tenderloin District in 1961. The man behind the phone wasn’t a therapist or counselor. His name was Bernard D. Mayes, a British priest and journalist alarmed by the high suicide rate in San Francisco and compelled to do something about it.\n\nBernard D. Mayes in 2006. Photo: Wikimedia Commons\n\nDecades before Google and other search engines started advertising the national hotline on suicide-related search results, Mayes put cardboard advertisements on the side of city buses: “Thinking of ending it all? Call Bruce, PR1–0450, San Francisco Suicide Prevention.” The name Bruce was an alias, but the message was sincere.\n\nMayes received a single call on the first night after placing his ads. He took the call from his couch. By the end of that week, he had 10 callers a day. Now, 50 years on, phones on similar hotlines across the U.S. ring hundreds of times a day, many of them modeled on Mayes simple approach.\n\nMayes passed away in 2014, but his legacy is one that has saved and enriched countless lives. He wasn’t a trained crisis counselor, but he did possess deep empathy for others. Mayes intuitively understood that what distressed people needed was a compassionate ear and someone they felt comfortable talking to. He told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2012, “It occurred to me that we had to have some kind of service which would offer unconditional listening and that I would be this anonymous ear.”\n\nTrained professionals play a critical role in suicide prevention, of course — but Mayes proved that anyone can provide life-changing emotional support by taking the time to listen with a nonjudgmental attitude. You don’t have to be an expert to make a difference.\n\nSign up for The Bold Italic newsletter to get the best of the Bay Area in your inbox every week.\n\nMayes had a big idea and followed his calling even though he wasn’t quite sure how he’d pull it off. He knew his calling was to provide this service for people who were struggling and had nowhere else to turn. But with no staff, no office space, and no funds, the only place he could set up his hotline was his apartment.\n\nUnfortunately, landlords weren’t keen on the idea of a tenant who was up all hours of the night. Mayes was repeatedly turned away by landlords until he met an apartment manager in the Tenderloin district. He explained his mission of wanting to provide a listening ear for those considering suicide. To his surprise, the manager pulled back his long sleeves to reveal his own scarred wrists. The manager offered Mayes the apartment at 965 Geary Street for half price.\n\nBeyond his suicide prevention hotline, Mayes had many other impressive accomplishments. He was a journalist, professor, author, priest, founding chairman of National Public Radio, and gay rights activist. He didn’t pigeonhole himself into a single career or trajectory — he had many identities and passions and fully embraced them all. Mayes’ life was a testament to the fact that your seemingly disparate interests all have something in common: you. Life is an opportunity to try on as many personas as you wish.\n\nIn the 50 years since Mayes founded San Francisco Suicide Prevention, suicide rates in San Francisco have declined by 50%. Mayes never took credit for this — since the hotline is anonymous, he would never say for sure whether he’d ever saved a life.\n\nA pedestrian takes a phone call across the street from the Tenderloin’s Dalt Hotel, where a person died by suicide in 1988. Photo: Luis Sinco\/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nTo Mayes, the focus was always that he wanted to help people, and he knew that people calling into a hotline desperately needed help. He said, “We don’t go around asking people if they are suicidal, see. They call us. … It almost worked by magic.”\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"On September 21st, 2019, the world witnessed a momentous occasion - the United Nations’ International Day of Peace. This day is celebrated every year to promote the idea of peace among nations and individuals. The theme for the year 2019 was “Climate Action for Peace”. This theme was chosen due to the alarming impact of climate change on our planet, which poses a significant threat to our world and its inhabitants.\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon that is affecting every corner of the world. The scientific community has provided ample evidence that climate change is a result of human activities, such as deforestation and the use of fossil fuels. This has led to an increase in global temperatures, rising sea levels, and severe weather events. These changes have significant impacts on our environment, including the loss of biodiversity and disruption of ecosystems.\n\nThe United Nations’ International Day of Peace aimed to raise awareness among individuals, governments, and organizations about the impact of climate change on our planet. It encouraged people from around the world to take action and work towards mitigating the effects of climate change. The day also highlighted the importance of peace in achieving this goal.\n\nPeaceful solutions are vital to addressing the impact of climate change. Conflicts over natural resources, such as water and land, are often at the root of environmental degradation. By working towards a peaceful solution, we can reduce the impact of climate change and protect our planet for future generations.\n\nThe International Day of Peace called on everyone to participate in making a difference. The need of the hour is to take individual and collective action to reduce our carbon footprint. We can start by making small changes in our daily lives, such as using renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable practices. Governments and organizations also have a significant role to play. By promoting sustainable development and investing in renewable energy, they can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute towards a healthier planet.\n\nAs responsible citizens of the planet, we must understand the impact of our actions on the environment. Climate change is a global problem, and it requires a global solution. We must work together, across borders and cultures, to address this issue. It is only by working together that we can bring about the change we need to preserve our planet for future generations.\n\nApart from the United Nations’ International Day of Peace, September 21st also marks the beginning of the Autumnal Equinox. This astronomical event is significant as it marks the start of the fall season in the Northern Hemisphere. During the equinoxes, the tilt of the Earth's axis is neither tilted towards nor away from the sun. This results in equal amounts of daylight and darkness all over the world.\n\nThe equinox was celebrated by various cultures throughout history. In ancient times, people believed that the equinox marked the balance between light and dark. They celebrated the harvest festival during this time, which marked the end of summer and the beginning of the fall season. The festival was a time of abundance, and people celebrated by feasting, dancing, and offering thanks to the gods for a bountiful harvest.\n\nThe fall season is significant for various reasons. It marks a time of change and transformation, as the leaves change colors and fall from the trees. The cooler weather also marks a change in food habits, with pumpkin spice and apple cider becoming popular choices. The fall season also marks the beginning of the school year, and students return to classes after a long summer break.\n\nThe Autumnal Equinox is a reminder of the importance of balance in our lives. We must strive to find balance between our work and personal lives and strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance. We must also focus on finding balance in our relationships, where we give and receive love equally. Finally, we must strive to find balance in our relationship with the planet. We must aim to live sustainably and reduce our carbon footprint to protect our planet for future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, September 21st is a day of significant importance on various levels. The United Nations’ International Day of Peace reminds us of the importance of working towards a peaceful world while also protecting the planet from the impact of climate change. The Autumnal Equinox reminds us of the importance of balance and transformation in our lives. We must take these lessons to heart and work towards creating a better world for ourselves and future generations. We must work towards creating a world where peace and sustainability go hand in hand. Only by working together, can we create a world where every individual and the planet thrives.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nCovid-19 Live Updates: Americans Gather for Thanksgiving at a Moment of National Peril\n\nThe Thanksgiving holiday is approaching and many Americans are eagerly looking forward to this annual tradition. This year, however, the holiday is being observed in the midst of a pandemic that has brought the United States to a moment of national peril.\n\nThe novel coronavirus, which emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has caused a global pandemic that has affected every aspect of our lives. In the United States, the virus has infected over 12 million people and killed over 250,000. The country is currently experiencing a surge in cases that is threatening to overwhelm hospitals and healthcare workers.\n\nDespite the risks posed by the pandemic, many Americans are planning to celebrate Thanksgiving as normal, with large family gatherings and travel. This decision has been met with concern from public health officials, who warn that such gatherings could result in a surge in cases and deaths.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for Thanksgiving celebrations, recommending that Americans avoid travel, limit the size of gatherings, and take other precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. However, these guidelines have been criticized by some as unrealistic and overly restrictive.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Americans may be hesitant to follow the CDC's guidelines. For one, Thanksgiving is a deeply ingrained tradition in American culture, and many families see it as a time to come together and celebrate. Additionally, many Americans are skeptical of the severity of the pandemic, and may not believe that the risks posed by the virus are significant enough to justify canceling their plans.\n\nThe reality, however, is that the pandemic is far from over, and the risks posed by the virus are very real. Experts warn that large gatherings are a major contributor to the spread of the virus, and that the effects of this year's Thanksgiving celebrations could be devastating.\n\nSome states and cities have taken steps to discourage large gatherings and limit the spread of the virus. In California, for example, Governor Gavin Newsom has instituted a curfew for most residents and banned all nonessential travel. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced that schools will be closed starting on November 19th due to rising case numbers.\n\nDespite these measures, however, many Americans are still planning to celebrate Thanksgiving with large gatherings and travel. This decision could have serious consequences not just for those who attend these gatherings, but for the country as a whole.\n\nThe pandemic has already caused a great deal of economic and social hardship, and it will likely continue to do so for some time. In addition to the loss of life, the pandemic has caused widespread job losses, business closures, and financial instability. If the pandemic is allowed to continue unchecked, these effects could become even more severe.\n\nFortunately, there are steps that Americans can take to help limit the spread of the virus and protect themselves and others. These include wearing masks, practicing social distancing, avoiding large gatherings, and following other guidelines recommended by public health officials.\n\nIt is also important for Americans to stay informed about the latest developments in the pandemic, and to take action to protect themselves and others. This may include staying up-to-date on vaccination efforts, advocating for policy changes that prioritize public health, and supporting organizations that are working to combat the pandemic.\n\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, it is clear that this year's celebrations will be unlike any other. Americans will need to navigate the challenges of the pandemic and find ways to celebrate safely and responsibly. With the right precautions and a commitment to protecting ourselves and others, we can help limit the spread of the virus and ensure that future Thanksgiving celebrations are not marred by this national peril.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Rpy2 Made Easy\n\nA consolidated guide at using Rpy2 for beginners\n\nTwo data scientists walked into a bar. Both of them wanted to use R from Python. Lo and behold — Rpy2.\n\nRpy2 (R’s embed in python) can be pretty intimidating to use and solely because it’s not as well fleshed out as its individual parts. Also because it is much easier to use R and python by themselves, but certain software architectures might require a consolidation of the two. Python’s intuitive data structures, visual libraries and great IDE’s mixed with R’s trusted packages make for a solid resource for a data scientist’s exploitation.\n\nHow to Setup\n\nDownload Python3+ and R, if you haven’t already. Install the Rpy2 from here\n\nUsing R packages and function from Python\n\nThe following example below shows how to call existing R functions from python using appropriate packages. The imports to be made are the following:\n\n#Import necessary packages\n\nimport rpy2.robjects as robjects\n\nfrom rpy2.robjects.packages import importr\n\nfrom rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri\n\n#Must be activated\n\npandas2ri.activate()\n\nThe below snippet shows how to import R objects and packages to python. The time series object and forecast package from R are used in the example. One needs to make sure these functionalities\/packages work fine in R separately.\n\ntime_series=robjects.r('ts')\n\nforecast_package=importr('forecast')\n\nTime to use functions from forecast package in python:\n\n#converting the training data into an R time series object\n\nr_times_series_data=time_series(df[\"Actuals\"].values,frequency=12) #fit the Time series into a model\n\n#Using auto_arima\n\nfit_arima=forecast.auto_arima(r_times_series_data,seasonal=False) #getting the forecast value\n\nforecasted_arima=forecast_package.forecast(fit_arima,h=10,level=(95.0))\n\nThe variable “forecasted_arima” is a List Vector, an R datatype. One can print the columns names to find the desired columns. The following lines can be used to find the forecasted result:\n\n#The 3rd index has the forecast value for Arima.\n\n#NOTE: THE INDEX MAY NOT BE SAME FOR ALL MODELS\n\narima_output=forecasted_arima[3]\n\nAlternatively, one can access the columns with their names as follows:\n\n#Alternate way to find forecasted result\n\narima_output=forecasted_arima .rx2(\"mean\")\n\nCalling Existing R functions from Python\n\nSuppose, one has a R code as follows:\n\n#Saved in the file Forecast_r_function.r\n\nlibrary(forecast)\n\nForecast_r_function= function(actuals, freq){\n\ny <- ts(actuals,frequency = freq)\n\nfit <- auto.arima(y, seasonal=TRUE)\n\nforecasted = forecast(fit, h=5)\n\nreturn (forecasted)\n\n}\n\nThe call the above forecast function from python, the following import needs to be made:\n\n\n\nfrom rpy2.robjects.packages import STAP #Import the SignatureTranslatedAnonymousPackage from rpy2.robjects.packages import STAP #Read the file with the R code snippetwith open('Forecast_r_function.r', 'r') as f:\n\nstring = f.read() #Parse using STAP\n\nforecast_func_in_python= STAP(string, \"Forecast_r_function\")\n\nThe above step makes the R function available from python. It can be accessed by:\n\n#Calling R function\n\nforecasted_arima=forecast_func_in_python . Forecast_r_function (time_series, 10)\n\n#storing result\n\narima_output=forecasted_arima .rx2(\"mean\")\n\nConclusion\n\nThere are many other ways Rpy2 can be used in a python framework, including ways to write R code in python itself. However those are more prone to error that the ones elucidated here.\n\nWorking with both R and Python are done regularly by data scientists, and an interface to embed one on the other is truly powerful if used well. Despite it not being very popular, rpy2 can provide technical edge to data scientists and developers alike while designing and integrating a holistic systems.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}

Let's take a brief look at the history of Silicon Valley in this three-part series.\n\nThe story of Silicon Valley starts in the early 20th century when semiconductors were first discovered. Semiconductors are materials that can conduct electricity, but not as well as metals. They are used to create the electronic devices that we use every day, such as computers and smartphones.\n\nIn the 1950s, a research lab called Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory was founded in Mountain View, California. The lab was founded by William Shockley, who was one of the inventors of the transistor, which is a device that controls the flow of electric current. The lab attracted many brilliant scientists and engineers who wanted to work on the cutting edge of technology.\n\nIn 1957, eight of these scientists left Shockley's lab to start their own company, called Fairchild Semiconductor. They wanted to create a new type of transistor that was smaller and more efficient than the ones that had been invented before. They succeeded, and their invention quickly became popular with electronics manufacturers.\n\nFairchild Semiconductor became very successful, and many other semiconductor companies were founded in the area. These companies were located in an area known as the \"Valley of Heart's Delight,\" which was famous for its fruit orchards. The valley is now known as Silicon Valley because of the high concentration of tech companies that have set up shop there.\n\nIn the 1970s, two young entrepreneurs named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer in a garage in Los Altos, California. They wanted to create a personal computer that was easy to use and affordable. Their first computer, the Apple I, was a success, and they went on to create more advanced machines like the Apple II and the Macintosh.\n\nAnother company that was founded in the 1970s was Intel, which is now one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. Intel was founded by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, who had previously worked at Fairchild Semiconductor. They wanted to create a new type of memory chip that was faster and more reliable than the ones that were currently available. They succeeded, and their invention helped to fuel the growth of the computer industry.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Silicon Valley continued to grow and attract more companies and entrepreneurs. Many of the companies that were founded during this time became household names, like Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo. These companies were able to create new products and services that changed the way we live, work, and communicate.\n\nToday, Silicon Valley is home to thousands of tech companies, from small startups to large corporations. The area is known for its highly educated workforce and its entrepreneurial spirit. Many people come to Silicon Valley to start their own companies or to work for some of the most innovative companies in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Silicon Valley has a rich history that dates back to the early days of semiconductors. The area has been home to many groundbreaking companies and entrepreneurs who have created some of the most important technologies of our time. In the next part of this series, we will take a closer look at some of the key players in Silicon Valley's history and how they helped to shape the tech industry as we know it today.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAesopica is Still Relevant\n\nAesopica is a collection of stories that have been passed down from ancient Greece. These stories are full of moral lessons that people can use to guide their lives. Even though they were written thousands of years ago, Aesopica is still relevant today. In this essay, we will discuss why these stories are still important and how they can help us become better people.\n\nOne reason that Aesopica is still relevant is that the stories are timeless. The morals that are taught in these stories are universal and can be applied to any time period or culture. For example, one of the most famous Aesop fables is \"The Tortoise and the Hare.\" In this story, the hare is overconfident and takes a nap while the tortoise slowly and steadily crosses the finish line. The moral of the story is that slow and steady wins the race. This moral is still applicable today, and we can all learn from it.\n\nAnother reason that Aesopica is still relevant is that the stories are relatable. The characters in these stories face challenges that we all can relate to. For example, in the story of \"The Ant and the Grasshopper,\" the grasshopper spends the summer singing and dancing while the ant works hard to store food. When winter comes, the grasshopper is left hungry while the ant has enough food to survive. This story teaches us the importance of hard work and saving for the future, which is something that we can all relate to.\n\nAesop's fables are also important because they teach us about the consequences of our actions. In many of these stories, the characters face consequences for their actions, whether they are good or bad. For example, in the story of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf,\" the boy lies about seeing a wolf, and when a real wolf appears, nobody believes him. This story teaches us the importance of telling the truth and being honest with others. By learning about the consequences of our actions, we can make better choices in our own lives.\n\nFinally, the stories in Aesopica are important because they are easy to understand. The language used in these stories is simple and easy to follow, which makes them accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. The morals in these stories are also straightforward, which makes them easy to remember and apply to our own lives. This is why Aesop's fables have been popular for thousands of years and will continue to be relevant in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, Aesopica is still relevant today because the stories are timeless, relatable, teach us about consequences, and are easy to understand. These stories have been passed down from ancient Greece and have stood the test of time. By reading and learning from Aesop's fables, we can become better people and make better choices in our own lives. So, the next time you come across an Aesop fable, remember the moral of the story and apply it to your life.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nWhen one thinks of the LGBTQ+ community and their fight for marriage equality, the first thing that comes to mind is the landmark Supreme Court decision in 2015. However, the fight for marriage equality began long before that, and there were brave individuals who paved the way for the rights we have today. One such couple was Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who made history by exchanging vows in 2004, becoming the first same-sex couple to legally marry in the United States.\n\nLyon and Martin were no strangers to the fight for LGBTQ+ rights. They were prominent activists in the San Francisco Bay Area, co-founding the Daughters of Bilitis, the first lesbian rights organization in the United States, in 1955. The organization provided support and a sense of community for lesbians at a time when being openly gay was heavily stigmatized and criminalized. Lyon and Martin were also involved in the civil rights movement and were part of the group that organized the first National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1979.\n\nTheir journey towards marriage equality began in 1993 when Lyon and Martin wrote a letter to San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan, requesting that he grant them a marriage license. The mayor declined, stating that same-sex marriage was illegal under state law. Lyon and Martin then took their case to court, arguing that the California Constitution's equal protection clause should allow them to marry. Unfortunately, the court ruled against them, and the ban on same-sex marriage remained in place.\n\nDespite this setback, Lyon and Martin continued to fight for marriage equality. They were part of the group that successfully sued the California government to recognize same-sex marriages performed outside the state in 2000. This was a significant victory, but it did not change the fact that same-sex couples could not legally marry within California.\n\nThe breakthrough came in 2004 when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered the city clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Lyon and Martin were among the first to receive one, and they were married on June 16, 2004, surrounded by friends, family, and supporters. The event was a testament to their decades-long fight for LGBTQ+ rights and a milestone in the struggle for marriage equality.\n\nThe joy was short-lived, however. The California Supreme Court invalidated the marriages a month later, stating that the mayor did not have the authority to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Despite this setback, Lyon and Martin's wedding had a lasting impact on the fight for marriage equality. It sparked a national conversation about the issue, and many other cities and states began to consider legalizing same-sex marriage.\n\nIn 2008, the California Supreme Court overturned the ban on same-sex marriage, allowing Lyon and Martin, and thousands of other same-sex couples, to legally wed. However, this victory was short-lived, as Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage, was passed by voters later that year. It wasn't until 2013 that the ban was overturned, and in 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\nLyon and Martin's wedding may have happened over 16 years ago, but their fight for LGBTQ+ rights and marriage equality continues to inspire and impact the community today. They faced discrimination, stigma, and legal barriers, but they never gave up on the fight for equality. Their story is a reminder that progress doesn't happen overnight, and that it takes the tireless work of activists like Lyon and Martin to make change happen.\n\nIn conclusion, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin's wedding was not only a historic moment in LGBTQ+ history, but it was also a symbol of hope and resilience for the community. They fought for decades to achieve marriage equality, and their legacy continues to inspire and impact the LGBTQ+ community. Their story is a reminder of the power of activism and the importance of never giving up on the fight for equality. Lyon and Martin will always be remembered as trailblazers and heroes in the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe world of visual illusions is fascinating and captivating. Impossible figures, in particular, have intrigued researchers and artists for centuries. These figures often challenge our cognitive abilities, as our brains struggle to make sense of the contradictory information presented to them. In this essay, we will explore the factors that make an impossible figure impossible, and the cognitive processes behind our perception of these figures.\n\nAn impossible figure is a two-dimensional or three-dimensional representation that appears to be an object or shape that cannot exist in reality. These figures are usually designed to present conflicting information to our visual system, and thus they cannot be comprehended by our brain. The most famous example of an impossible figure is the Penrose triangle, also known as the impossible triangle, which depicts a three-dimensional object that appears to have three sides that connect in a continuous loop, creating an impossible object.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the impossibility of these figures. Firstly, impossible figures often rely on conflicting perspectives, where lines or shapes appear to converge or diverge in ways that cannot be reconciled with our understanding of geometry. Secondly, they often rely on the use of hidden or overlapping lines, where different parts of the figure seem to overlap or intersect, making it impossible to determine the true shape of the object. Finally, impossible figures often rely on the ambiguity of depth perception, where the figure seems to change shape or orientation depending on the angle from which it is viewed.\n\nTo understand why these factors make an impossible figure impossible, we need to delve into the cognitive processes behind our visual perception. Our brains have evolved to interpret the visual information we receive from our eyes and create a coherent and meaningful representation of the world around us. This process involves several cognitive functions, including attention, memory, and perception, among others. When we encounter an impossible figure, our visual system tries to make sense of the conflicting information presented to it. However, since these figures violate our understanding of geometry and perspective, our brain cannot create a coherent representation of the object, and thus it appears as an impossible or irrational figure.\n\nOne of the key factors that contribute to the impossibility of these figures is the use of conflicting perspectives. In traditional perspective drawing, lines converge towards a single point, creating the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality. However, impossible figures often use conflicting perspectives, where lines are drawn in a way that contradicts our understanding of perspective. For example, the Penrose triangle appears to have three sides that connect in a continuous loop, which is impossible in three-dimensional space. This effect is achieved by drawing the lines in a way that creates conflicting visual cues, making it impossible for our brain to reconcile the different perspectives and create a coherent representation of the figure.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the impossibility of these figures is the use of hidden or overlapping lines. These figures often rely on the use of geometric shapes that overlap or intersect in ways that cannot be reconciled with our understanding of geometry. For example, the Necker cube is a classic example of an impossible figure, where the lines of the cube appear to overlap or intersect, creating an ambiguity in the orientation of the object. This ambiguity makes it impossible for our brain to determine the true shape of the object, and thus it appears as an impossible figure.\n\nFinally, impossible figures often rely on the ambiguity of depth perception, where the figure seems to change shape or orientation depending on the angle from which it is viewed. This effect is achieved by drawing the lines in a way that creates conflicting visual cues about the orientation of the object. For example, the Penrose stairs appear to be a staircase that loops back on itself, creating an impossible object. This effect is achieved by drawing the stairs in a way that creates conflicting visual cues about the orientation of the object, making it impossible for our brain to determine the true shape of the stairs.\n\nIn conclusion, impossible figures are fascinating objects that challenge our cognitive abilities and our understanding of geometry and perspective. These figures are designed to present conflicting information to our visual system, making it impossible for our brain to create a coherent representation of the object. The key factors that make an impossible figure impossible are the use of conflicting perspectives, hidden or overlapping lines, and the ambiguity of depth perception. By understanding the cognitive processes behind our perception of these figures, we can appreciate the intricate and complex nature of visual illusions and the artistry and ingenuity behind their creation.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"I may have given the trail designers too much credit: a later examination of the map reveals that we could have detoured around the base of the Eildon Hills and arrived at the same spot on the other side — a grove of beech trees — without little effort. I can’t help but believe that Cuthbert would have opted for the more sensible (flat) course.\n\nOn the other hand, Bede suggests that Cuthbert was a creature of these mountains, roaming the slopes, preaching, teaching, and spreading the Gospel among the Anglo-Saxons who had settled here. His fame spread to such an extent that an Abbess named Ebbe begged Cuthbert to visit her monastery in Coldingham in order to offer instruction to the monks and nuns who lived under her guidance. Cuthbert did not want to reject the entreaties of such a distinguished lady (she was the daughter of Aethelfrith, first king of Northumbria), and so he traveled to Coldingham.\n\nCuthbert’s ascetic practices, like the trail named after him, were rigorous; the sisters and brothers living at Coldingham were reputed to be a bit soft. Although they had withdrawn from the world, they still enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle. Cuthbert spent a few days at Coldingham, watching and taking note. Their ascetic practices did not rise to his lofty standards, so he began to slip away at night to exercise his spirit in private.\n\nHis absences were noted by the monks and nuns at Coldingham. One evening, a monk spotted Cuthbert slipping into the night. He assumed the worst: Cuthbert must be on his way to a romantic tryst. The monk decided to follow the visitor and expose him as a pious fraud. Much to his surprise, Cuthbert marched straight to the beach, waded into the frigid waters of the North Sea, and did not stop walking until he had immersed himself to his neck. Then, following the Irish custom, he spent the night in prayer, arms raised above the waterline.\n\nWhen dawn touched the eastern sky, Cuthbert waded back to the shore. A pair of otters followed, frolicking in his wake. The two animals took turns rubbing Cuthbert, drying him with their soft fir. After they had completed their task, the saint blessed them, and then returned to the monastery in time to share the morning office with the brothers.\n\nI suppose the moral of the story is that Cuthbert never avoided hardship: maybe he would have chosen the steep and taxing way.\n\nThe Eildon Hills, now (thankfully) behind us. Author photo.\n\nHaving descended like Moses from the mountains, we pass through a wood and decide to have our lunch at a picnic table on the outskirts of Bowden, the first village on our trek. This land once belonged to the Kelso Abbey, and later was the ancestral home of Scotland’s Ker family. There’s not much here today. We don’t linger.\n\nFrom Bowden the trail follows a ridge through a rural landscape. We hike along a watercourse, the Bowden Burn, which leads us into our first major town, Newtown St Boswells. As its name suggests, Newtown St Boswells is a “new town,” only dating back to the sixteenth century. I don’t know if we are simply caught up in the moment, or if Newtown has little to recommend it, but we do not stop. Up over another hill, through a dilapidated residential district, and then, with a sigh of relief, back into open country.\n\nPastoral Landscapes, Saint Cuthbert’s Way, Scotland. Author photo.\n\nEventually we reach the Tweed River, which will be our companion for several hours this afternoon. I find the path along the river a bit trying: the trail attempts to stay close to the water, but in doing so, continually gains and loses elevation. It is like walking a roller coaster track, up and down, dodge left, shunt right. Moreover, it is a narrow path — more deer run than trail — and finding a flat place upon which to set my feet requires an annoying degree of alertness.\n\nIn places the river grows shallow and accelerates, water scraping across spreading files of rapids and pebble bars.\n\nThen one last big push and we are back in civilization again. St Boswells, a tiny town that shares its High Street with St Cuthbert’s Way. It feels like it should be enough, but our day is not over yet.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAnglo-Saxon Studies, also known as Early English Studies, has been a subject of controversy in the academic world due to its association with white supremacy. Although the field itself focuses on the language, literature, and culture of the Anglo-Saxon period in England, some have used it as a way to perpetuate a false narrative of white superiority. This essay will explore the ways in which Anglo-Saxon Studies has been co-opted by white supremacists, the harm it causes, and how scholars are fighting against it.\n\nHistorically, Anglo-Saxon Studies has been a predominantly white field. However, this does not necessarily equate to it being inherently racist. It was only when white supremacists appropriated the subject that it became problematic. In recent years, white nationalists have attempted to use the Anglo-Saxon period as a way to legitimize their beliefs. They argue that the Anglo-Saxons were the “true” founders of England and that their culture is the basis of English identity. This narrative is used to justify exclusionary policies and to promote the idea of a \"pure\" white English race.\n\nThis appropriation of Anglo-Saxon Studies is not only harmful but also inaccurate. The idea of a “pure” Anglo-Saxon race is a myth, as the Anglo-Saxons themselves were a mixture of different peoples, including the Celts, Romans, and Vikings. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxons were not the only group to have influenced English identity. The Normans, for example, who invaded England in 1066, also played a significant role in shaping English culture, language, and literature.\n\nOne of the ways in which white supremacists have tried to use Anglo-Saxon Studies to promote their agenda is through the use of symbols. The most notorious of these symbols is the swastika, which has been appropriated by white nationalists as a way to represent their movement. However, they have also used other symbols, such as the Anglo-Saxon runes, to create a sense of authenticity for their beliefs. This has led to the runes being associated with white supremacy, even though they are a legitimate part of Anglo-Saxon Studies.\n\nThe use of symbols is not the only way in which white supremacists have co-opted Anglo-Saxon Studies. They have also distorted the history and culture of the period to suit their needs. For example, they have claimed that the Anglo-Saxons were the “true” founders of England and that they were responsible for its success. However, this is a simplification of history. The Anglo-Saxons were just one of many groups to have influenced the development of England, and their contributions cannot be separated from those of other cultures.\n\nAnother way in which white supremacists have distorted history is by claiming that the Anglo-Saxons were racially pure. This is a myth that has been debunked by scholars, who have shown that the Anglo-Saxons were a mixture of different peoples. Moreover, the Anglo-Saxon culture was not static but evolved over time, as contact with other cultures influenced it. By denying the complexity of Anglo-Saxon culture, white supremacists are not only simplifying history but also promoting a false narrative of white superiority.\n\nThe harm caused by the appropriation of Anglo-Saxon Studies by white supremacists is significant. It perpetuates a false narrative of white superiority and promotes exclusionary policies. Moreover, it creates an unwelcoming environment for scholars and students of color who may feel excluded from the field. It is, therefore, imperative that scholars work to combat this appropriation and ensure that Anglo-Saxon Studies is a welcoming and inclusive field.\n\nOne way in which scholars are fighting against the appropriation of Anglo-Saxon Studies is by confronting the use of symbols by white supremacists. They have been actively working to remove the association of the runes with white supremacy by promoting their legitimate use in academic contexts. Moreover, they have been working to educate the public about the history and meaning of these symbols, so that they are not co-opted for racist purposes.\n\nScholars have also been working to ensure that the history and culture of the Anglo-Saxon period are accurately represented. They have been challenging the myth of a “pure” Anglo-Saxon race and promoting a more nuanced understanding of the period. Moreover, they have been working to highlight the contributions of other cultures to the development of England, such as the Vikings and the Normans.\n\nFinally, scholars have been working to create a more inclusive environment for scholars and students of color. They have been advocating for greater diversity in the field and for the inclusion of different perspectives. Moreover, they have been working to ensure that the appropriation of Anglo-Saxon Studies by white supremacists is not tolerated and that their false narratives are challenged.\n\nIn conclusion, the appropriation of Anglo-Saxon Studies by white supremacists is a significant problem in the academic world. It perpetuates a false narrative of white superiority and creates an unwelcoming environment for scholars and students of color. Scholars are fighting against this appropriation by confronting the use of symbols, ensuring that the history and culture of the period are accurately represented, and creating a more inclusive environment. It is imperative that these efforts continue so that Anglo-Saxon Studies remains a legitimate field of study that is free from racist ideologies.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\n‘The End of the Affair’ by Graham Greene is a novel that presents a complex and engaging plot, full of emotional depth and intricate themes. The story revolves around Maurice Bendrix and Sarah Miles, two lovers who have an affair during the Second World War. The novel explores the nature of love, faith, jealousy, and betrayal, and it raises profound questions about the meaning of life and the existence of God. In this book review, I will discuss the main elements of the novel and the reasons why I found it a fascinating and thought-provoking reading experience.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of ‘The End of the Affair’ is its narrative structure. The story is told from the perspective of Maurice Bendrix, who is also the main protagonist of the book. However, the novel is not linear, and it jumps back and forth in time, presenting different stages of the love affair between Maurice and Sarah. This structure creates a sense of mystery and suspense, as the reader is not sure what is going to happen next, or how the story will unfold.\n\nAnother element that makes ‘The End of the Affair’ a powerful novel is its depiction of human emotions. Maurice and Sarah’s love affair is intense and passionate, but it is also complicated and troubled. Maurice is a jealous and possessive lover, who cannot stand the thought of Sarah being with other men. Sarah, on the other hand, is a deeply religious woman who struggles with guilt and doubt, and who feels torn between her love for Maurice and her faith in God. The novel portrays these conflicting emotions with great sensitivity and nuance, showing how love and faith can be both sources of joy and pain.\n\nOne of the central themes of ‘The End of the Affair’ is the nature of love, and how it can transform and transcend human existence. Maurice and Sarah’s love is not only a physical attraction, but also a spiritual connection that gives meaning and purpose to their lives. They are both outsiders, who feel alienated from the world and seek solace and comfort in each other. However, their love is also fragile and vulnerable, and it is threatened by external forces such as war, illness, and betrayal.\n\nThe novel also explores the limits of human love, and how it can be distorted by jealousy, possessiveness, and selfishness. Maurice’s jealousy and suspicion drive him to spy on Sarah, to read her diary, and to hire a private detective to follow her. He becomes obsessed with her, and his love turns into an obsession that consumes him. Similarly, Sarah’s guilt and fear make her withdraw from Maurice, and to seek refuge in her religious beliefs. She becomes distant and elusive, and their love starts to disintegrate.\n\nAnother important theme of ‘The End of the Affair’ is the search for meaning and purpose in life. Maurice and Sarah both feel a sense of emptiness and despair, and they look for something to fill the void. For Maurice, it is Sarah, who becomes his reason for living. For Sarah, it is God, who gives her hope and consolation. However, their search is not easy, and they face many obstacles and challenges along the way.\n\nThe novel also raises profound questions about the existence of God, and the role of faith in human life. Sarah’s religious beliefs are a central aspect of the novel, and they shape her actions and her worldview. She believes that God is present in the world, and that he watches over her and protects her. However, her faith is also tested by the events of the war, and by the doubts and uncertainties that arise from her love for Maurice. The novel presents a complex and nuanced exploration of the relationship between faith and doubt, and it shows how these two opposing forces can coexist and interact in human life.\n\nIn conclusion, ‘The End of the Affair’ is a masterful novel that explores the complexity of love, faith, and human emotions. It presents a compelling and engaging narrative, full of suspense and mystery, and it raises profound questions about the meaning of life and the existence of God. The characters of Maurice and Sarah are fully realized and three-dimensional, and their love affair is portrayed with great insight and sensitivity. The novel is a profound meditation on the nature of love and faith, and on the human condition itself. It is a book that will stay with the reader long after the last page has been turned, and it is one that I highly recommend to anyone interested in great literature.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nBoomer-Lit And The Silver Economy\n\nBoomer-Lit or \"Baby Boomer Literature\" is a genre of literature that caters to the age group of baby boomers who were born between the years 1946 and 1964. This genre is experiencing a surge in popularity as the baby boomer population is becoming a significant segment of the silver economy.\n\nThe silver economy is a term used to describe the economic power of the aging population. An aging population has specific needs and preferences, and they represent a considerable market force. The silver economy includes various industries such as healthcare, technology, finance, leisure, and even the publishing industry.\n\nThe baby boomer generation represents a massive demographic that is now entering their retirement and golden years. They are an affluent group and have a higher-than-average disposable income. With this economic power, the market is adapting to cater to this specific demographic, including the publishing industry.\n\nThe popularity of Boomer-Lit has risen in recent years as baby boomers seek literature that reflects their experiences and values. Boomer-Lit is characterized by themes of aging, retirement, family relationships, and personal growth. It reflects the changing social and cultural norms of society as the baby boomer generation ages.\n\nOne example of Boomer-Lit is the novel \"A Man Called Ove\" by Fredrik Backman. This novel tells the story of a curmudgeonly older man who grapples with the difficulties of aging and the loss of his wife. The novel portrays the values of the baby boomer generation, such as hard work, loyalty, and resilience. The popularity of this novel is a testament to the appeal of Boomer-Lit to not only the baby boomer generation but also to younger audiences who want to understand and connect with their parents and grandparents.\n\nThe rise of Boomer-Lit can also be attributed to the aging of the publishing industry itself. Many authors and editors who spearheaded the Baby boomer literature movement are now retiring. Publishers are now seeking authors who can connect with the baby boomer generation and their values. This creates a symbiotic relationship between the publishing industry and the baby boomer generation.\n\nThe silver economy has also created an opportunity for self-publishing authors. The rise of digital publishing platforms such as Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing and Barnes and Noble Press has removed the barriers to entry in the book publishing industry. Self-publishing authors can now cater to the specific needs of the baby boomer audience, creating a more diverse selection of Boomer-Lit novels.\n\nThe popularity of Boomer-Lit also reflects the changing attitudes of society towards aging. The baby boomer generation is keen on aging gracefully and productively. This demographic is not content with the traditional notions of retirement and aging. They want to pursue new hobbies, travel, and engage in social activities. This change in attitude has resulted in a new genre of literature that reflects their desires and aspirations.\n\nBoomer-Lit is also a means of preserving the historical and cultural memory of the baby boomer generation. Baby boomers are the product of a unique time in history that saw significant social and cultural transformations. Their experiences are a valuable record of this time's events and can provide insights into the challenges that face society today.\n\nIn conclusion, the silver economy has created an opportunity for Boomer-Lit to thrive. The baby boomer demographic is a significant market force, and the publishing industry is adapting to cater to their specific needs and preferences. The popularity of Boomer-Lit reflects the changing attitudes towards aging and the value of preserving cultural and historical memory. As the baby boomer generation ages, Boomer-Lit will continue to be a popular genre that reflects their experiences, values, and aspirations.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAdolf Hitler, one of the most infamous figures in history, is known for his role as the leader of the Nazi Party and the architect of the Holocaust. During the Second World War, Hitler was the driving force behind the German military campaign and was seen as a crucial element to the success of the Nazi regime. However, as the war began to turn against the Germans in the final stages of the conflict, many speculated about the fate of Hitler. One theory is that Hitler was able to escape the Berlin Siege and evade capture by the Allied forces. In this essay, we will explore the evidence surrounding this theory and evaluate its plausibility.\n\nBefore we delve into the evidence, it is important to understand the context surrounding the Berlin Siege. In April of 1945, Allied forces were closing in on Berlin, the capital of Nazi Germany. The city was heavily fortified, and the German forces were determined to fight to the bitter end. However, on April 30th, Hitler reportedly committed suicide in his bunker as the Allies closed in. According to the official story, Hitler shot himself in the head while also taking a cyanide pill. His body was then carried to the surface and burned by his aides.\n\nHowever, there are several reasons to believe that Hitler may have escaped the Berlin Siege. The first and most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that no definitive proof of Hitler's death has ever been found. While the official account claims that Hitler's body was burned and disposed of, there is no physical evidence to support this claim. In fact, the only physical evidence that exists is a fragment of a skull that was believed to be Hitler's. However, this fragment was not conclusively identified until 2018 and has been the subject of much controversy. Some experts believe that the skull fragment belonged to a woman, not Hitler.\n\nAnother reason to believe that Hitler may have escaped is the fact that many of his closest aides, including Martin Bormann, were able to escape Berlin during the final days of the war. It seems unlikely that Hitler, who was the most important figure in the Nazi hierarchy, would have been unable to secure an escape route for himself. In fact, there are several accounts of Hitler discussing possible escape routes with his aides in the weeks leading up to his alleged death.\n\nOne of the most compelling pieces of evidence supporting the theory that Hitler escaped is the eyewitness accounts of several people who claim to have seen Hitler in the years following the war. There are reports of Hitler being spotted in places as far-flung as Argentina, Spain, and even Antarctica. While some of these sightings may be the result of mistaken identity or wishful thinking, there are several instances where the description of the person matches Hitler's appearance.\n\nFinally, there is the fact that the Soviet Union, which was the occupying power in Berlin after the war, did not release any information about Hitler's death until 1965. This delay in releasing information has given rise to suspicions that the Soviet Union may have been complicit in helping Hitler escape. It is worth noting, however, that the Soviet Union had a vested interest in discrediting the Nazi regime and may have wanted to downplay Hitler's role in the final days of the war.\n\nDespite this evidence, there are many who remain skeptical of the theory that Hitler escaped the Berlin Siege. The official account of Hitler's death has been widely accepted for decades, and there are many who believe that the evidence supporting the theory of his escape is circumstantial at best. Critics of the theory also point out that Hitler's health was in a state of decline in the final days of the war, and it seems unlikely that he would have been able to survive for long after escaping Berlin.\n\nThere are also several counterarguments to the evidence supporting the theory of Hitler's escape. For example, the fact that no one has ever produced a definitive account of Hitler's escape suggests that if he did escape, he did so with a very small circle of confidants. This seems unlikely, given the size and complexity of the Nazi regime.\n\nAnother counterargument is that the evidence supporting Hitler's escape is based on rumors and hearsay rather than hard evidence. Eyewitness accounts of Hitler's whereabouts in the years after the war are often contradictory and unreliable, and many historians believe that they are the result of people wanting to believe in a more dramatic ending to Hitler's story.\n\nIn conclusion, the theory that Hitler escaped the Berlin Siege remains controversial to this day. While there is some evidence supporting the theory, it is mostly circumstantial and has been contradicted by the official account of Hitler's death. Ultimately, the truth about Hitler's fate may never be known for certain. However, the debate over whether he was able to escape the Berlin Siege serves as a reminder of the enduring fascination with one of the most notorious figures in modern history.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"Georges Seurat’s painting of a Sunday afternoon in Paris appears, at first glance, to celebrate the carefree hours of a series of well-to-do families.\n\nThe colours are glowing, almost luminous, as if the sun that shines down on this strip of land has somehow woven into the fabric of the canvas and has been captured there, forever shining.\n\nSeurat achieved this effect by making his painting with tiny dots of pure colour. He was a student of colour theory and studied the works of Michel Eugène Chevreul and other colour theorists active at the time. Instead of mixing paints on his palette, Seurat applied them to the canvas directly with the intention that the colours would mix on the eye of the viewer.\n\nDetail of ‘A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte’ (1884–1886) by Georges Seurat. Oil on canvas. Art Institute of Chicago. Image source Wikimedia Commons\n\nIt is this effect which gives the painting that shimmering, slightly unstable quality. Every form is made up of thousands of dots and dashes. Seurat worked on the painting over several years in the second half of the 1880s, building up the painting in careful layers to establish this tremulous effect.\n\nThe scene takes place on a mile-long island on the River Seine in Paris known as La Grande Jatte.\n\nDoused in sunshine, yet taking shade beneath trees and umbrellas, the visitors to the island rest and stroll with an unhurried air. It was a favourite pleasure-spot of the Parisian bourgeois, a place to retreat from the bustle of the working week and the pollution of the city. (The island remains popular with modern-day Parisians, along with actors and celebrities who have taken up residence there).\n\nSeurat was not the only artist to visit the island and make paintings there. Claude Monet, Alfred Sisley and Vincent van Gogh all produced artworks with views of the La Grande Jatte. The setting agreed with one of the core ideas of Impressionism: to paint contemporary life in a real-world setting. Along with the practice of using loose, spontaneous brush marks to capture the fleeting effects of light, Impressionist painters chose to paint public places — bars, theatres, circuses, restaurants, parks — as a means of arriving at the most direct and vivid description of their city and its environs.\n\nGeorges Seurat shared many of the same interests as his contemporary artists. Yet, whilst other Impressionists and Post-Impressionists worked with an unplanned spirit, Seurat took a more meticulous approach, both in the planning of his compositions and the application of his paint.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of Seurat’s enormous painting — it is more than three metres wide — is the way he has separated out all of the different figures into isolated groupings. It is easier to see this if you stand back from the painting: see how the green of the grass weaves like a sea across the span of the canvas, casting all the individuals (or small groups) into distinct islands.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"\n\nToday's world is a digital era where everything is just a click away. We all use social media platforms to connect with family, friends, and colleagues. However, have you ever wondered if you have lost your IRL self amidst the virtual world? IRL means \"In Real Life,\" referring to the physical world that exists outside the internet. It has become a common phenomenon among teenagers and young adults these days to portray an online personality that is entirely different from who they are in real life.\n\nThe internet has provided us with a platform where we can showcase our best sides, share our achievements, and express our opinions. Social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter allow us to create a persona that is more attractive, confident, and glamorous than our actual selves. We tend to exaggerate our lives and present ourselves in a way that we think others would perceive as cool and trendy.\n\nIn the virtual world, we can choose our friends, manipulate our images, and filter our lives. We can create a perfect version of ourselves that we can never become in real life. The problem is that when we get too involved in this fantasy world, we tend to forget who we are in real life. We lose touch with our inner selves, and our self-esteem is dependent on the likes and comments we receive on our social media posts.\n\nThe pressure to maintain the perfect image that we have created for ourselves online takes a toll on our mental well-being. We start to compare ourselves to others, and the fear of missing out or not being popular enough builds up. It leads to a constant need for validation, and we get caught up in a vicious cycle of seeking approval from others instead of focusing on our own growth and development.\n\nWe need to understand that the online world is just a fragment of our lives. It is imperative to disconnect ourselves from the virtual world and focus on our real-life relationships and experiences. Instead of living for the gram, we should live for ourselves. We should cherish our genuine relationships and embrace our flaws, rather than trying to hide them.\n\nIt is also essential to be aware of the dangers that come with oversharing on social media. The internet is a vast space, and once we put our information out there, we lose control over who can access it. It is not uncommon for people to fall prey to cyberbullying, identity theft, and catfishing. We need to be responsible for what we share online and limit the personal information that we put out there.\n\nMoreover, it is vital to prioritize our mental health and well-being over our virtual selves. We should not allow the opinions of anonymous strangers on the internet to define our self-worth. We need to cultivate a healthy relationship with social media platforms and use them as a tool for self-expression, instead of relying on them for validation.\n\nIn conclusion, it is easy to get lost in the virtual world and forget who we are in real life. It is crucial to prioritize our mental health and well-being over our online personas. We need to disconnect ourselves from the internet and focus on our real-life relationships and experiences. We should not allow the opinions of others to define our self-worth and should embrace our flaws and imperfections. The internet should be a tool for self-expression rather than a platform for seeking validation. Remember, you are more than just your Instagram profile. You are a unique individual with qualities and talents that no one else possesses. So, embrace your uniqueness, and let your real self shine through.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}

{"prompt":"\n\n‘The End of the Affair’ by Graham Greene is a novel that tells the story of Maurice Bendrix, a man who falls in love with Sarah Miles, a married woman. It is set in London during the Second World War and is an interesting novel that delves into the themes of love, jealousy, and faith.\n\nThe novel is narrated by Bendrix himself, who is a writer. He tells the story of his affair with Sarah and how it ended. The novel begins with Bendrix returning to London after a bomb causes part of his house to collapse. He is confronted by his memories of his affair with Sarah, which he wishes to put behind him.\n\nThe novel is divided into three parts, each of which is narrated by Bendrix. The first part tells of his initial meeting with Sarah and how she became his lover. The second part focuses on Sarah’s relationship with her husband, Henry Miles. The third part is about the end of Bendrix’s affair with Sarah.\n\nOne of the dominant themes of the novel is love. Greene explores the different types of love that exist between the characters. Sarah is married to Henry, but she is not happy in her marriage. She falls in love with Bendrix, and they begin an affair. However, Sarah’s love for Henry also remains, and she finds herself torn between the two men.\n\nBendrix’s love for Sarah is intense and all-consuming. He is jealous of Henry, whose love for Sarah seems to be stronger than his. Bendrix wants Sarah to leave Henry and be with him, but Sarah is torn between her love for both men.\n\nAnother theme of the novel is jealousy. Bendrix is jealous of Sarah’s love for Henry, and his jealousy often leads him to behave in irrational ways. He hires a private detective to follow Sarah and tries to find evidence of her infidelity. However, his jealousy is not entirely unfounded, as Sarah admits to having an affair with another man before she met Bendrix.\n\nThe novel also explores the theme of faith. Bendrix is an atheist who believes that there is no such thing as God. However, Sarah is a devout Catholic who believes in God and the power of prayer. She often prays for Bendrix, hoping that he will find faith. Bendrix is skeptical of Sarah’s faith and believes that it is a sign of weakness. However, his views on faith are challenged when he experiences a miraculous event that he cannot explain.\n\nOne of the strengths of the novel is its complex characters. Bendrix is not always likeable, and his jealousy often makes him difficult to sympathize with. However, Greene does an excellent job of showing the reader his vulnerabilities and insecurities. Sarah is also a complex character, torn between her love for two men and her faith in God. Henry is not a major character in the novel, but he is portrayed as a loving husband who is devoted to his wife.\n\nAnother strength of the novel is its setting. The novel is set in London during the Second World War, and Greene does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the time. The war is a constant presence in the novel, and it provides a backdrop for the characters’ actions.\n\nThe novel’s structure is also interesting. The fact that it is divided into three parts, each narrated by Bendrix, allows the reader to see the story from different perspectives. It also allows the reader to see how the characters develop over time.\n\nHowever, the novel is not without its weaknesses. The pacing of the novel is slow, and at times, it feels like not much is happening. Additionally, the ending of the novel is unsatisfying. It feels rushed, and the reader is left with unanswered questions.\n\nIn conclusion, ‘The End of the Affair’ by Graham Greene is a fascinating novel that explores the themes of love, jealousy, and faith. The complex characters and the setting make the novel an interesting read. However, the pacing of the novel is slow, and the ending is unsatisfying. Overall, I would recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys reading about complex relationships and exploring the themes of faith and love.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\n“Yes, the Body:” A Quarantined Review of Spawn\n\nDuring this time of quarantine, many of us have found ourselves turning to different forms of entertainment to pass the time. For me, that has been catching up on some classic comic book series that I missed out on when I was younger. One of these series is Spawn, created by Todd McFarlane in 1992. Upon reading the first few issues, I was struck by the intense focus on the body and the physical aspects of the character. This led me to explore the themes of the series, particularly the way in which they are explored through the body.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand who Spawn is. The character, whose real name is Al Simmons, is a former U.S. Marine and CIA operative who is betrayed and killed by his own men. He is then sent to Hell for his sins, where he makes a deal with the devil to return to Earth as a Hellspawn, in order to see his beloved wife once again. However, upon returning to Earth, he finds that five years have passed and his wife has moved on with her life. Spawn is therefore left to figure out his new existence as a demonic entity, while also seeking revenge on those who wronged him in his former life.\n\nAt the core of the series is the theme of redemption. Spawn is initially presented as a character who is tortured by his past sins and is seeking a way to make up for them. This is reflected in the way the character is depicted physically. He is covered head to toe in a demonic suit, which represents his new existence as a Hellspawn. The suit is also a physical representation of his sins, as it begins to deteriorate over time and reveal his true self underneath. In this way, the body becomes a metaphor for the character’s internal struggles.\n\nFurthermore, the body is central to the series’ exploration of power dynamics. Spawn is initially presented as a character who is at a disadvantage, as he is a Hellspawn stuck in a human world. However, he quickly learns to harness his demonic powers and use them to his advantage. This is reflected in the way the character is drawn, with his body constantly transforming and mutating as he gains new abilities. The body becomes a visual representation of the character’s power, with McFarlane’s detailed illustrations making it clear just how formidable Spawn is.\n\nIn contrast, other characters in the series are often depicted as physically weaker than Spawn. This is particularly notable in the way female characters are portrayed. While Spawn is muscular and imposing, the female characters are often drawn in exaggerated poses, with their bodies contorted into sexualized positions. This is particularly evident in the character of Wanda, Spawn’s former wife, who is depicted as a conventionally attractive, blonde woman. Her body is often shown in revealing clothing or in positions that accentuate her curves, such as leaning forward or bending over. This depiction of female characters is problematic, as it reinforces harmful stereotypes about women and their bodies.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this is not always the case. There are moments in the series where female characters are depicted as strong and powerful. The character of Angela, a warrior angel who becomes a major player in the series, is drawn with a muscular physique and a commanding presence. Her body is used to communicate her strength and fighting prowess. Similarly, the character of Cyan, a young girl who becomes embroiled in Spawn’s world, is depicted as having a powerful psychic ability. While her body is not depicted in the same way as Angela or Spawn, it is clear that her strength comes from within, rather than from her physical appearance.\n\nFinally, the body is central to the series’ exploration of mortality. Spawn’s new existence as a Hellspawn means that he is technically immortal. However, his body is constantly decaying, and he is forced to rely on the finite resources of his suit to stay alive. This constant decay is a reminder of his mortality, and of the fact that he is still bound to the physical world. This is particularly evident in the series’ depiction of Spawn’s food cravings. As a Hellspawn, Spawn no longer needs to eat, but he finds himself craving certain foods from his past life. This is a reminder that, despite his demonic powers, he is still tied to his human body and his mortal past.\n\nIn conclusion, Spawn is a series that is deeply concerned with the physical aspects of the body. Whether it is Spawn’s transformation into a Hellspawn, the depiction of female characters, or the exploration of mortality, the body is always at the forefront of the narrative. While there are moments where the series’ representations of the body are problematic, there are also moments where they are used to great effect in exploring themes of power, redemption, and mortality. As I continue to read through the series during this time of quarantine, I am struck by just how central the body is to the world of Spawn.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe Bible in Word Clouds\n\nThe Bible is considered one of the most important religious texts in the world. It contains valuable teachings and lessons for people from all walks of life. The language in which the Bible was written is captivating and deep. Scholars have been studying the Bible for centuries, and there are still many discoveries to be made.\n\nOne of the most exciting new tools for analysing the Bible is the word cloud. A word cloud, also known as a tag cloud, is a visual representation of text data. It is a collection of words that are displayed in varying sizes and colors, depending on their frequency within the text.\n\nBy creating word clouds of the Bible, scholars can quickly see the most common themes and topics. It can help to identify important passages that are often overlooked, and it can provide a fresh perspective on familiar stories. But how does one go about creating a word cloud of such a lengthy and complex text?\n\nThe first step is to obtain a digital version of the Bible. There are many websites that offer the Bible in various formats, including PDF, HTML, and plain text. Once the text is downloaded, it can be analysed using various software programs, such as Wordle or Tagul.\n\nThe software will analyse the text and create a word cloud based on the frequency of each word. The most frequently used words will appear in larger font sizes, while less frequent words will appear smaller. The colors of the words can also be adjusted, based on the user’s preference.\n\nThe results of the word cloud analysis can be fascinating. For example, one word cloud of the New Testament revealed that the most frequently used words were “Jesus,” “God,” “man,” “kingdom,” and “love.” These words reflect the central themes of the New Testament and provide insight into the beliefs and values of the Christian faith.\n\nAnother interesting use of word clouds is to compare different versions of the Bible. Different translations of the Bible can vary in their word choice and syntax, which can affect the overall meaning of the text. By creating word clouds of two or more versions of the same passage, scholars can identify these differences and gain a deeper understanding of the original text.\n\nWord clouds can also be used to highlight specific passages or themes within the Bible. For example, a word cloud of the book of Proverbs revealed that the most frequently used words were “wisdom,” “knowledge,” “righteousness,” and “understanding.” These words reflect the focus of the book of Proverbs, which is to provide practical guidance for daily living.\n\nIn conclusion, word clouds are a powerful tool for analysing the Bible. They can provide a fresh perspective on familiar texts and reveal new insights into the themes and topics within the Bible. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that even more sophisticated methods of analysing the Bible will become available. But for now, word clouds remain a valuable resource for scholars and students of the Bible.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe study of history has always been a fascinating subject, and the lives of the poor in archaic Greece are no exception. Life was harsh for the average person in ancient Greece, especially for those who were living in poverty. The Greeks of this era were a civilization that was always on the move, and poverty was an unfortunate reality for many of them.\n\nThe lives of the poor in Archaic Greece were difficult, and often looked vastly different than that of the wealthy. They were required to work hard for their survival, living in limited and often unsanitary conditions. They were often unable to afford the basics, such as food, clothing, and shelter. With little ability to improve their living conditions, it was not uncommon for them to succumb to disease and malnutrition.\n\nDuring this period, Greece was not a united country, but instead, city-states ruled by kings or aristocrats that controlled the lives of the majority of the population, the poor. These city-states were far from egalitarian and showed a great disparity between the rich and the poor. The elites saw themselves as superior and often looked down on the poor. Many of the elites viewed themselves as demigods and felt that they had the right to treat the poor as underlings. The poor were, however, the backbone of the society, as they performed most of the labor that kept the city-state alive.\n\nThe lack of technological development meant that the poor had to work long hours to make ends meet. They were tasked with doing heavy manual labor, such as farming, mining, or building. Their compensation was low, and they lived in simple dwellings. Their lack of resources was exacerbated by the fact that they had few opportunities for personal advancement. Poverty was a vicious cycle that was hard to break out of, and if they were unlucky, the poor could fall even further.\n\nThe poor often had to resort to charity to survive. It was common for the wealthy to give alms and food to the poor, but this was not out of the goodness of their hearts. It was a way to secure their position in society, as the poor held no power, and the elites feared that they would revolt if they were neglected. It was a way to keep them loyal, even though it was a short-term solution. Charity was a way to pacify the poor, but it did nothing to improve their living standards.\n\nAmong the poor, women were the most vulnerable group. The ancient Greeks were a patriarchal society, with women occupying a lower status than men. Women were restricted to a domestic sphere and were not allowed to work outside of the home unless they were slaves. Some elite women, however, were exceptions to this rule, as they were well-educated and ran their estates in the absence of their husbands. However, the poor women did not have that luxury. They worked long hours, taking care of their children, cooking, cleaning, and spinning wool. They had to be frugal with their resources and often had only basic clothing.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges faced by the poor was the lack of healthcare. Disease was rampant, and with no understanding of germs or viruses, people had no way to fight infections. Doctors were only available to the wealthy and were expensive even for them. The poor had to rely on folk medicine, which had limited effectiveness, or make-do with what they had. This meant that many people died from illnesses that could have been easily treated if they had access to proper healthcare.\n\nOne aspect of the poor’s lives that came with some advantages was religion. Religion was omnipresent in ancient Greece, and it was no different for the poor. The temples were accessible to everyone, regardless of their status in society, and people went there to seek solace, guidance, and sometimes, even medical treatment. The festivals held in honor of the gods were open to everyone, and they provided a welcome break from the monotony of daily life. This provided a sense of community and belonging that was hard to come by in other parts of their lives.\n\nIn conclusion, life for the poor in archaic Greece was challenging, and they had to endure hardships that are unimaginable in modern times. They had limited access to healthcare, education, and opportunities for advancement, and poverty was a vicious cycle that was hard to break out of. The elites viewed them as underlings, often looking down on them and treating them as expendable. Despite this, the poor were the backbone of the society, and they performed most of the labor that kept the city-state alive. They relied on charity to survive, and their vulnerability made them susceptible to exploitation. It was a harsh reality, but it was the way of life for the vast majority of the people.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nEvelyn McHale’s Most Beautiful Suicide\n\nOn May 1, 1947, a young woman named Evelyn McHale ended her life by jumping from the 86th floor of the Empire State Building. She landed on a parked limousine, and the impact was so severe that her body was barely recognizable. However, despite the gruesome nature of her death, one particular photograph taken by Robert Wiles has been widely recognized as “the most beautiful suicide.” This image has become a part of popular culture, and it has inspired countless works of literature, music, and art. But what exactly makes this photograph so compelling, and why has it captured the imagination of so many people?\n\nTo answer these questions, it is necessary to understand the circumstances that led to McHale’s tragic decision. According to her family, she had been dealing with personal issues and had recently broken up with her fiancé. In a note that she left behind, McHale wrote, “I don’t want anyone in or out of my family to see any part of me. Could you destroy my body by cremation? I beg of you and my family – don’t have any service for me or remembrance for me. My fiance asked me to marry him in June. I don’t think I would make a good wife for anybody.” These words suggest that McHale was struggling with feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness, and that she saw death as the only way to escape her problems.\n\nIt is important to note that McHale was not the only person who chose to end her life by jumping from the Empire State Building. In fact, before the installation of suicide barriers in the 1940s, the building was a popular site for suicides. However, it was McHale’s photo that became famous, and it is this image that has come to represent the tragedy of suicide in popular culture. Part of the reason why this photograph is so striking is that it captures McHale’s body in a moment of suspended animation. Her pose is graceful and almost balletic, as if she were performing a high dive into a pool. The fact that she is wearing a pretty dress and gloves adds to the poignancy of the image, as it suggests that she was not a stereotypical “suicide victim.” Instead, she was a young woman who wanted to be remembered as beautiful and elegant.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the power of this photograph is the perspective from which it was taken. Robert Wiles, the photographer who captured McHale’s image, was a freelance cameraman who had been assigned to cover the aftermath of the suicide. When he arrived at the scene, he saw McHale’s body on the roof of the car, and he immediately recognized the potential of the image. However, he did not simply take a straightforward photograph of the body. Instead, he positioned himself above the car and captured a shot looking down at McHale’s body, with the cityscape of New York in the background. This perspective gives the photograph a sense of depth and scale, as it emphasizes the height of the building and the vastness of the city. At the same time, it creates a sense of intimacy, as if the viewer were looking down on McHale from a position of privilege.\n\nOne of the most interesting aspects of this photograph is the way that it has been interpreted by different artists and writers. For example, the poet Sylvia Plath wrote a poem called “The Disquieting Muses” in which she makes reference to McHale’s suicide. Plath, who herself committed suicide a few years later, was clearly fascinated by the idea of a beautiful young woman choosing to end her life. She wrote:\n\n“Mother of beetles, only unclench your hand:\nI'll fly through the candle's mouth like a singeless moth.\nGive me back my shape. I am ready to construe the days\nI coupled with dust in the shadow of hours,\nrobbing my own lips of a voice.”\n\nThis poem suggests that Plath identified with McHale’s sense of despair, and that she saw suicide as a way to escape the pain of being alive. Similarly, the singer Lana Del Rey has written a song called “13 Beaches” in which she refers to McHale’s image. In this song, Del Rey sings, “I don’t belong in the world, that’s what it is \/ Something separates me from other people \/ Everywhere I turn, there’s something blocking my escape.” These lyrics suggest that Del Rey, like Plath, sees McHale as a kind of alter ego, and that she too feels disconnected from the world.\n\nOf course, not everyone has been moved by McHale’s photograph in the same way. Some critics have argued that the image is exploitative and voyeuristic, and that it reduces McHale to a mere object of aesthetic contemplation. They argue that the photograph, along with the famous headline “Beauty in Death,” glamorizes suicide and glosses over the complex psychological issues that led to McHale’s decision. Moreover, they argue that the image is insensitive to the feelings of McHale’s family and friends, who must constantly be reminded of her death by seeing her image in the media.\n\nDespite these criticisms, I believe that Evelyn McHale’s photograph has a legitimate place in our cultural history. It is a reminder of the profound impact that suicide can have on individuals and communities, and it challenges us to think more deeply about the social and psychological factors that lead to suicide. At the same time, it is a work of art in its own right, and it has inspired many other artists to reflect on the themes of beauty, despair, and mortality. Ultimately, the power of this photograph lies in its ability to capture the fleeting and fragile beauty of human life, even in its most tragic moments.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nRushing the Growler: A Risky Business\n\nThe craft beer industry is booming, and with it, the popularity of growlers. Growlers have become a sought-after commodity for beer enthusiasts looking to take home their favorite brews. However, the rush to fill and sell these containers can come at a cost. Growlers require specific guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of the product. Rushing the growler process can lead to dangerous situations for both the customer and the brewery.\n\nA growler is a container used to transport beer from a brewery or taproom. These containers are usually made of glass, ceramic, or stainless steel and come in various sizes ranging from 32 oz. to 128 oz. Growlers are popular among beer enthusiasts because they allow customers to take home fresh beer straight from the tap. However, the rush to fill and sell these containers can lead to potentially hazardous situations.\n\nThe first step in filling a growler is to clean and sanitize it properly. The growler must be thoroughly cleaned to ensure that no residue or bacteria remain, which can affect the taste of the beer. If the growler is not cleaned correctly, bacteria can grow, which can lead to a foul smell and taste in the beer. In addition to cleaning, the proper sanitization of the growler is also essential. Sanitization is a process that kills any bacteria remaining in the growler. If the growler is not sanitized correctly, the beer can have a sour taste, can foam excessively, or can become contaminated with harmful substances.\n\nGrowlers must also be filled correctly to ensure the beer's quality and safety. The first step in filling the growler is to purge it with carbon dioxide. Purging removes any remaining oxygen from the growler, which can cause the beer to go stale. After purging, the growler is filled with beer from the tap. It is essential to fill the growler quickly without overfilling it. Overfilling can cause the beer to foam excessively and lead to a loss of carbonation. Once filled, the growler must be sealed immediately to prevent air from entering and causing the beer to go flat.\n\nRushing the growler-filling process can lead to dangerous situations. If the growler is not cleaned or sanitized properly, harmful bacteria can grow, posing a health risk to the consumer. In addition, if the growler is not filled correctly, the beer can become contaminated or lose its carbonation, affecting the taste and quality. Rushing the process can also lead to overfilling the growler, causing excessive foam and a loss of beer.\n\nCustomers can also play a role in the safety of the growler. It is essential to keep the growler clean and to store it properly. After consuming the beer, the growler should be rinsed with hot water and soap as soon as possible. Any remaining beer or sediment can cause bacteria growth and affect the taste of future beers. The growler should also be stored in a cool, dark place and not in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause the beer to go stale and lose its carbonation.\n\nIn addition to the safety concerns, rushing the growler process can also affect the taste and quality of the beer. Beer is a delicate beverage that requires specific guidelines to maintain its unique flavor profile. Rushing the growler process can disrupt the beer's balance and cause it to taste different than intended.\n\nCraft breweries take great pride in creating unique and flavorful beers. Rushing the growler process can compromise their efforts and create an unsatisfactory experience for the consumer. Brewing beer is not a fast process, and neither should the growler-filling process. Properly cleaning, sanitizing, and filling the growler takes time and attention to ensure the safety and quality of the product.\n\nIn conclusion, rushing the growler-filling process can lead to dangerous situations for both the consumer and the brewery. Growlers must be cleaned, sanitized, and filled correctly to ensure the beer's quality and safety. Rushing the process can cause bacteria growth, contamination, and loss of carbonation, affecting the beer's taste and quality. Consumers also play a role in the safety and quality of the growler, and proper care and storage are essential. Craft breweries take great pride in creating unique and flavorful beers, and rushing the growler process can compromise their efforts. The rush to fill and sell growlers must be avoided to ensure a safe, flavorful, and enjoyable experience for all.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nAutomobile enthusiasts all over the world know the name Lamborghini as one of the leading manufacturers of luxury sports cars. However, not many people know that the company actually started out as a producer of farm equipment, mainly tractors. Yes, you read it right. Lamborghini, the brand that is now synonymous with speed, power, and sophistication, was once a humble manufacturer of farming machinery.\n\nFerruccio Lamborghini, the founder, started his business in the aftermath of World War II, when Italy was struggling to rebuild its economy. He initially focused on producing tractors to cater to the needs of the farmers in the region. However, being the enterprising man that he was, he soon expanded his business by making air conditioning units, heaters, and other industrial tools. Eventually, he became one of the wealthiest businessmen in the country.\n\nIt was not until the early 1960s that Lamborghini decided to venture into the automobile industry. The story goes that he was unhappy with the performance of his Ferrari sports car and decided to confront Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari, about the issue. However, Ferrari dismissed his complaints, saying that a mere tractor manufacturer like Lamborghini could not understand the intricacies of building sports cars. This insult drove Lamborghini to create his own sports car, one that would outperform Ferrari's models.\n\nThe first Lamborghini sports car, the 350 GT, was unveiled in 1964. It was an instant success, with its V12 engine, sleek design, and impressive performance. The company continued to impress car enthusiasts with models like the Miura, Countach, and Diablo. These cars became symbols of status and luxury, coveted by the rich and famous.\n\nToday, Lamborghini continues to produce some of the most advanced and sought-after sports cars in the world. The Aventador, Huracán, and newer models like the Sian and Urus have cemented Lamborghini's position as a leader in the supercar industry. However, the company has not forgotten its roots, and still produces tractors under the name Lamborghini Trattori.\n\nSo, what made Lamborghini's transition from tractors to sports cars so successful? One factor was Ferruccio Lamborghini's passion for engineering and innovation. He was never satisfied with the status quo and was always looking for ways to improve his products. This drive for excellence is evident in Lamborghini's sports cars, which are known for their cutting-edge technology and exceptional performance.\n\nAnother factor was the timing of Lamborghini's entry into the automobile industry. In the 1960s, the demand for high-performance sports cars was growing. Lamborghini was able to capitalize on this trend and offer something unique and exciting to car enthusiasts who were tired of the same old models offered by traditional brands like Ferrari and Porsche.\n\nFinally, Lamborghini's success can be attributed to its marketing strategy. The company has always positioned itself as a luxury brand, appealing to those who value exclusivity and prestige. Lamborghini's cars are not just vehicles; they are symbols of status and power. The company has also succeeded in creating a cult-like following among car enthusiasts, who eagerly await each new model release and attend Lamborghini-sponsored events like the Super Trofeo series.\n\nIn conclusion, Lamborghini's journey from tractors to supercars is a fascinating example of how a company can evolve and adapt to changing markets. Ferruccio Lamborghini's determination and innovation, combined with a growing demand for high-performance sports cars and a successful marketing strategy, helped Lamborghini become one of the most iconic luxury car brands in the world. While Lamborghini's tractors may not be as glamorous or exciting as its sports cars, they serve as a reminder of the company's humble beginnings and its commitment to engineering excellence.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"The Rich History of Sumo Wrestling\n\nAn inside look at Japan’s national sport\n\nSumo Wrestlers grappling. Photo by Bob Fisher on Unsplash\n\nYou may think it’s a bizarre sport featuring nothing more than large men grappling, but Sumo wrestling is the crown jewel of Japanese sport. Wrestlers lead highly disciplined lifestyles, having everything regulated from their meals to their manner of dress. They spend every minute together, training, eating, and sleeping together in stables.\n\nThe history\n\nAncient drawing of Sumo wrestlers. Photo by the Japan Sumo Association\n\nOriginating over 1,000 years ago, Sumo incorporates elements of Shinto — the native religion of Japan. Back in ancient Japan, Sumo was performed as a ritual dedicated to the gods as a prayer for good harvests.\n\nIn the Edo period (1603–1868), Sumo became regulated, with tournaments being held to fund shrines and temples. In the process, the sport’s audiences transitioned from the elite to the masses, commercializing the sport and creating professional sumo wrestlers.\n\nToday, many traditions are still preserved such as wrestlers clapping their hands to attract the attention of the gods, tossing sacred salt to appease the gods, and stomping their feet to drive evil spirits away from the ring.\n\nThe rules\n\nRyogoku Kokugikan, Tokyo. Photo by author\n\nTaking place in a clay ring (Dohyo), matches are contested between two wrestlers, with the first to knock down or push out the opponent winning. There is no time limit, although most matches last less than one minute.\n\nInside the ring, wrestlers can pretty much do anything, from slapping to tripping, to defeat the opponent. However, they can’t punch, poke sensitive areas, or pull hair. Additionally, if a wrestler’s loincloth (Mawashi) comes off, it leads to immediate disqualification.\n\nThough it sounds simple, there are actually eighty-two winning techniques (Kimarite) which a wrestler deploys to win the match, such as a leg tripping, throwing, and pushing out.\n\nUnlike most other professional combat sports, Sumo has no weight or height classes, occasionally creating mismatches of over 100kg (220lbs). The current average weight of first-division wrestlers is around 160kg (353lbs), with the all-time heaviest sumo wrestler, Anatoly Mikhakhanov, weighing a whopping 288kg (635lbs).\n\nFortunately for the mere mortals, it’s not just about size. Factors such as experience, speed, and agility play an equal part in the sport.\n\nRankings\n\nThere are six tournaments held in a year. Each tournament is fifteen days long, with wrestlers competing in one match per day.\n\nBased on their win-loss record at the end of the tournament, wrestlers are promoted or demoted ranks.\n\nSumo’s highest rank is the Yokozuna (Grand Champion), which is considered a god-like figure in Japan, being publicly recognized and earning upwards of one million USD annually. To earn a promotion to the highest rank, a wrestler has to win two consecutive tournaments. To illustrate its difficulty, there have only been seventy-two Yokozuna in the history of the sport, out of the thousands of challengers who have set foot on a clay ring. Currently, there are 702 professional sumo wrestlers.\n\nOnce a wrestler reaches the Yokozuna rank, he can never be demoted — though he is expected to retire if he cannot uphold the rank’s standards.\n\nLifestyle\n\nSumo wrestlers training at a stable. Photo by author\n\nSumo wrestlers lead highly regimented lifestyles. Since the age of fifteen, they live in a stable, where they train, eat, and live alongside other wrestlers. Prize money earned by the wrestlers is then split between them and the stable, thereby aligning their interests.\n\nTheir diet mainly consists of Chanko Nave, a stew with a mix of proteins, vegetables, and broth. The actual ingredients vary by personal preference but typically include fish, meat, and lettuce. For those looking to put on some weight, Chanko Nave is also available in restaurants across Japan for regular citizens.\n\nGiven the enormous size of the wrestlers, most people believe they sit around eating all day. However, the reality is that they only eat two meals a day — lunch and dinner. As they typically train in the morning, they don’t tend to have breakfast, since grappling on a full-stomach is probably not the best idea.\n\nFollowing lunch, the sumo wrestlers take a long nap before they eat again for dinner.\n\nControversies\n\nThough the sport is still immensely popular in Japan, a long list of controversies has resulted in fewer Japanese youngsters aspiring to become professionals. The scandals include:\n\n1. Match-fixing\n\nGiven the fifteen-match tournaments, the last match becomes the decider for those with a seven to seven win-loss record. However, some opponents are already guaranteed a promotion (eight to six record for example) meaning they have less of an incentive to win. In these scenarios, it’s easy to picture the Japanese mafia (Yakuza) getting involved in match-fixing, as has unfortunately been the case all too often.\n\n2. Training regime\n\nAs much as sumo wrestlers are expected to be tough, stables have been known to cross a line during training. Among the most notable cases was that of Takashi Saito, a teenage sumo wrestler who died after receiving a beating at his stable. Triggered by the tragic event, a further investigation into training regimes revealed that over 90% of stables had used baseball bats on their wrestlers at some point.\n\n3. Yokozuna Harumafuji’s Aggression\n\nIn 2017, Yokozuna Harumafuji was charged with assault after attacking junior wrestler Takanoiwa during a night out. Though not entirely clear, the incident was allegedly triggered by Takanoiwa not paying enough respects to Harumafuji. Given the public upheaval of the incident, the sport’s reputation was tarnished, especially as a Yokozuna is expected to act as an exemplary citizen.\n\nWith its strengths and shortcomings, Sumo is undoubtedly a unique sport deeply entrenched in tradition, that still resists the pressures of an increasingly globalized world.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" human"}
{"prompt":"Photography by Jeremy Roberts\n\nFlanking the northeast side of the Alapaha River at Sheboggy — a mile and a half east of Alapaha, Georgia — a small-scale creosote plant owned by Bertie Moore once existed post-World War II until about 1957. Derived from the distillation of black tar from coal or wood — beech trees are a common source in the eastern United States — creosote is a dirty, thick preservative found on railroad cross ties and wood fence posts. It has since been prohibited for residential use as carcinogens can be leeched into groundwater.\n\nAt Sheboggy drawing knifes were used to peel pine posts so creosote, likely pre-purchased from another location, could be affixed. The creosote-treated posts were then placed in a cylindrical, metal boiler and heated in river water for a certain period of time. Upon removal, drying for several days made them stronger and resistant to rotting. Farmers, including Gene Griffin, would purchase the posts to stake in the ground and keep wire fences taut and standing. Metal T-posts are significantly more prominent today.\n\nIt is unclear why the Sheboggy operation was abandoned. Reliable laborers may have been few and far between, or supplies may have grown cost-prohibitive. All in all, it was pretty back-breaking work. Neighborhood fish fries did occur for awhile until the shelter fell down. However, the rusting boiler, secured on a two-wheeled axle, remains. An alternate theory posits that it was part of a steam engine-driven sawmill. Prior to World War II, a portable sawmill did function southeast of the river near the remnants of the dilapidated, one-story brick building which sold bait and tackle, fabric, and liquor at various times. A gristmill also stood somewhere along the mill branch [creek] running west under Gladys Road and crisscrossing the properties of Ronnie Brogdon and Donald Stodghill to the river.\n\nCreosote plant employees included Moore’s brother-in-law Julius Brogdon, Tom McMillan, and Becky Davis’s father Purley Harper. Julius also assisted Moore at the fabled Sheboggy night spot, torn down long ago and situated on the northeast side of the river within walking distance of the creosote plant and an honest-to-goodness poker house. State representatives, sheriffs, and judges would covertly meet there on Saturday evenings. The enterprising Moore was a champion poker player who traveled extensively before his death at age 73 in 1984. And a moonshiner.\n\nJulius’s nephew Ronnie loved to blow the boiler horn when he was a little boy. Settling into a career as a district utility engineer with the Georgia Department of Transportation, Ronnie acquired the property until his accidental passing at age 72 in May 2016. Working under a dump truck, the hydraulic lift malfunctioned, causing the body to suddenly collapse on him. A Brogdon family trust retains possession. Research assistance was provided by Becky Davis, Gene Griffin, Sandy Harper, Darrell Jernigan, and Blake McCranie.\n\nOwned by Bertie Moore, the infamous Sheboggy game room offered beer and wine, pool tables, Citgo gasoline, beautiful sycamore trees, and affordable excitement for weary farmers wishing to kick back and shoot the breeze until it was bulldozed in 1989 to make way for the divided four-lane Highway 82.

{"prompt":"\n\nLondon’s Ego\n\nLondon, the capital city of the United Kingdom, is known for its rich history, iconic landmarks, and vibrant culture. However, beneath its surface lies an ego that can sometimes overshadow its many virtues. London’s ego has been a topic of discussion for many years, with some arguing that it is a necessary trait for a city to thrive while others believe it can lead to arrogance and complacency. In this essay, we will explore the various factors that contribute to London’s ego and the potential consequences of this characteristic.\n\nOne of the most significant factors that contribute to London’s ego is its status as a global financial center. As one of the largest financial hubs in the world, London is home to some of the most powerful and influential institutions and individuals on the planet. The City of London, which is the financial district of the city, is renowned for its high concentration of banks, investment firms, and multinational corporations. This concentration of wealth and power has undoubtedly contributed to the ego of the city, as it often feels as though London is the center of the world.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to London’s ego is its cultural dominance. London is home to some of the world’s most famous museums, art galleries, and theaters, and its cultural exports have had a significant impact on the world. From Shakespeare to the Beatles, London has produced some of the most significant cultural icons in history. This cultural dominance has undoubtedly contributed to London’s ego, as it often feels as though the city is the center of the cultural universe.\n\nFurthermore, London’s status as a global city, a hub of international trade and commerce, is another factor that contributes to its ego. London is a melting pot of cultures, with people from all over the world coming to live, work, and study in the city. As a result, London has become a global city, with connections and influence stretching across the globe. This status as a global hub has undoubtedly contributed to London’s ego, as it often feels as though the city is leading the way in terms of global trends and developments.\n\nDespite the many positive aspects of London’s ego, there are also potential negative consequences of this trait. One of the most significant potential consequences is arrogance. When a city believes that it is the center of the world, it can become complacent and dismissive of other cultures and ways of life. This arrogance can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding, which can be damaging to relationships with other cities and countries.\n\nAnother potential consequence of London’s ego is a lack of innovation and progress. When a city believes that it is already the best, it can become complacent and fail to invest in new technologies or ideas. This lack of innovation and progress can lead to the city falling behind other cities that are more willing to take risks and try new things.\n\nAdditionally, London’s ego can also contribute to social inequality. The concentration of wealth and power in the financial sector can lead to a widening gap between the rich and poor, with those who are not part of the financial elite feeling left behind. As a result, the city may become divided, with different parts of the city having vastly different levels of wealth and opportunity.\n\nSo, what can be done to mitigate the potential negative consequences of London’s ego? One potential solution is greater humility and empathy. London can recognize that it is not the center of the world and that there are other cultures and ways of life that are equally important. By showing greater empathy and understanding towards other cities and countries, London can build stronger relationships and avoid the potential pitfalls of arrogance.\n\nAnother solution is greater investment in innovation and progress. London can recognize that it cannot rest on its laurels and that it must continue to invest in new technologies and ideas to maintain its position as a global leader. By investing in research and development and supporting startups and entrepreneurs, London can ensure that it remains at the forefront of global trends and developments.\n\nFinally, addressing social inequality should also be a priority for the city. London can work to reduce the gap between the rich and poor by implementing policies that promote greater social mobility and opportunity for all. By providing access to quality education, affordable housing, and healthcare, London can ensure that all its residents can thrive and contribute to the city’s overall success.\n\nIn conclusion, London’s ego is a complex and multifaceted trait that has both positive and negative aspects. While London’s status as a global financial center, its cultural dominance, and its status as a global hub have undoubtedly contributed to its ego, there are also potential negative consequences, including arrogance, a lack of innovation, and social inequality. To mitigate these potential negative consequences, London can show greater humility and empathy, invest in innovation and progress, and work to address social inequality. By doing so, London can continue to thrive and succeed as a global city while also avoiding the potential pitfalls of its ego.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nThe study of Anglo-Saxon culture and history, also known as Early English Studies, is a significant part of academia. However, it is not immune to the influence of white supremacy. The concept of white supremacy, essentially the belief in the superiority of the white race, has permeated various aspects of our society, including education. This essay will explore how the study of Anglo-Saxon studies has been impacted by white supremacy and how academia can address this issue.\n\nAnglo-Saxon studies or Early English studies refer to the study of the culture, language, and history of the Anglo-Saxon period in England from the fifth to the eleventh century. It is a field that has been primarily dominated by white scholars who have shaped the narrative of Anglo-Saxon England as a white, Christian, and insular society. A significant part of this narrative includes the myth of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism, which proposes that the Anglo-Saxons were unique and superior to other cultures. This myth has been used to justify the exclusion of people of color from the study of Anglo-Saxon history and a false sense of superiority among white scholars.\n\nThe myth of Anglo-Saxon exceptionalism and the exclusion of people of color from the study of Anglo-Saxon history can be traced back to the nineteenth century. During this period, there was a growing interest in the study of race and the origins of human civilizations. Scholars used the study of ancient cultures to justify the superiority of their own race and culture. This belief manifested in the idea of Teutonic exceptionalism, which proposed that the Germanic people, including the Anglo-Saxons, were superior to other cultures, and their language reflected this superiority.\n\nThe myth of exceptionalism has been perpetuated by scholars who believe that the Anglo-Saxons were a uniquely white and Christian society. This belief has led to an exclusionary approach to the study of Anglo-Saxon history and culture, where scholars have focused mainly on the contributions of white men. Additionally, the myth of exceptionalism has been used to promote the idea that the English language has pure Germanic roots, without any influence from other cultures, particularly those of people of color.\n\nThe exclusion of people of color from the study of Anglo-Saxon history has been further perpetuated by the use of the word “Anglo-Saxon” by white supremacists. The term has been used to emphasize white identity and promote the idea of a pure white race. It has played a role in the alt-right movement, where white supremacists have used Anglo-Saxon history and symbols to justify their beliefs in racial purity and exclusion.\n\nThe use of “Anglo-Saxon” by white supremacists has led to a backlash against the study of Anglo-Saxon history by people of color. Many scholars of color have expressed discomfort with the term “Anglo-Saxon” due to its association with white supremacy. This discomfort has led to the use of alternative terms such as “Early England” or “Old English” to describe the period and culture. However, the use of these alternative terms has not been widely adopted, and the term “Anglo-Saxon” remains prevalent in academia and popular culture.\n\nSo, what can academia do to address the impact of white supremacy on the study of Anglo-Saxon history and culture? Firstly, scholars need to acknowledge the influence of white supremacy on their field and work to dismantle it. One way to do this is to re-examine the myth of exceptionalism and challenge its validity. Scholars need to recognize the contributions of people of color to Anglo-Saxon history and culture and work to include their perspectives in their research.\n\nMoreover, scholars need to be mindful of their use of language and terminology. The use of the word “Anglo-Saxon” needs to be critically examined, and alternative terms used where appropriate, such as “Early England” or “Old English.” Furthermore, scholars need to be aware of the implications of their research and its impact on society. They should strive to present a more inclusive and accurate portrayal of Anglo-Saxon society that recognizes the diversity of its people and their contributions.\n\nFinally, academia needs to be more inclusive and welcoming to scholars of color. Diversifying the field of Anglo-Saxon studies will not only challenge the myth of exceptionalism but also bring new perspectives and approaches to the study of Anglo-Saxon history and culture. Additionally, the inclusion of scholars of color will help to address the impact of white supremacy on the field and ensure that it remains relevant and diverse.\n\nIn conclusion, the study of Anglo-Saxon history and culture has been impacted by white supremacy, perpetuated by the myth of exceptionalism and the exclusion of people of color from the field. Academia needs to address this issue by revisiting the myth of exceptionalism, being mindful of the use of language and terminology, and diversifying the field. It is only by acknowledging and dismantling the influence of white supremacy that we can develop a more inclusive and accurate understanding of Anglo-Saxon history and culture.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
{"prompt":"\n\nOn the night of September 7, 2021, the United States Hunter Jumper Association (USHJA) Wheeler Museum, located in Lexington, Kentucky, opened its doors for the much-anticipated debut of the ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit. As a college student interested in the equestrian world, I couldn't miss the opportunity to attend and learn more about the role of photography in the equine industry.\n\nThe USHJA Wheeler Museum is dedicated to preserving and promoting the history and heritage of the hunter and jumper disciplines. The museum houses an extensive collection of artifacts, memorabilia, and photographs that tell the story of the evolution of the sport from its roots in fox hunting to the present-day competitive events. The ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit adds a new dimension to the museum's collection, showcasing the work of talented equestrian photographers who capture the beauty and athleticism of horses and riders.\n\nThe exhibit features over 140 photographs by 50 different photographers, selected by a jury of industry professionals. The photos are arranged thematically, highlighting different aspects of the hunter and jumper disciplines, such as the grace and elegance of the horses, the athleticism and technique of the riders, and the excitement and drama of the competitions. The images range from striking action shots of horses jumping over obstacles to intimate portraits of horses and their human partners.\n\nAs I walked through the exhibit, I was struck by the sheer beauty and power of the horses captured in the photographs. The images were so vivid and lifelike that I could almost hear the pounding of hooves and the swishing of tails. The photographers have a remarkable eye for detail and composition, highlighting every muscle, every curve, and every expression of the horses. They also capture the close bond between horses and riders, conveying the trust, respect and communication that are essential to the success of the partnership.\n\nOne of my favorite images in the exhibit is a black and white photo of two horses jumping over a fence in tandem, taken by photographer James Leslie Parker. The horses are perfectly synchronized, with their legs extended and their bodies parallel to each other. The image captures the precision and coordination required for a successful jump, as well as the beauty and elegance of the horses in motion. Another powerful image is a portrait of a grey horse by photographer Eryn Kischer, titled ‘Brazen’. The horse's head is turned towards the camera, and his eyes are piercing and expressive. The photograph captures the intelligence and soulfulness of the animal, as well as his strength and majesty.\n\nThe exhibit also features several interactive displays, such as a photo booth where visitors can take their own equestrian-themed photos and a touch screen where they can explore the history of equestrian photography. These displays add an element of fun and engagement to the exhibit, making it accessible and enjoyable for visitors of all ages and backgrounds. I had a lot of fun taking photos with my friends and learning more about the evolution of photography as a medium.\n\nThe ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit is not only beautiful and entertaining but also educational and thought-provoking. The photographs showcase the diversity and vibrancy of the equestrian community, highlighting riders of all ages, genders, and backgrounds. They also raise important questions about the ethics and welfare of horses in the competitive world. How do we balance the desire for excellence and achievement with the responsibility to protect the horses' health and well-being? How can we ensure that the sport remains accessible and inclusive to all who share a passion for horses?\n\nIn a world where technology has made photography ubiquitous and disposable, the ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit reminds us of the power and value of a well-crafted photograph. The images capture not only a moment in time but also an emotion, a connection, a narrative. They celebrate the beauty and majesty of horses, the skill and dedication of riders and trainers, and the spirit of sportsmanship and camaraderie that defines the equestrian world. They also invite us to reflect on our own relationship with horses and to appreciate the bond that has existed between humans and equines for centuries.\n\nIn conclusion, the ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit at the USHJA Wheeler Museum is a must-see for anyone interested in photography and equestrian sports. The exhibit is a visual feast for the eyes, showcasing the work of talented photographers who capture the essence of the hunter and jumper disciplines. The interactive displays and educational panels provide context and depth to the exhibit, inviting visitors to engage with the photographs and reflect on the significance of horses in our lives. The ‘Through the Lens’ exhibit is a testament to the power of photography to capture the beauty and complexity of the world around us and to inspire us to see it with fresh eyes.\n\n===\n\n","completion":" ai"}
